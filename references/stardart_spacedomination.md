# Space Domination AKA Stardart

One of my favorite games from the 90s.

A modern release of stardart: http://www.spacedomination.org/index.php/play/


## Quick Facts

From manual: https://www.spacedomination.org/index.php/the-galaxy/

### World Population

The population regulates what and how many global facilities you can build as well as how fast building goes.

Industry used to be 4x population. Is it still true?

### World Moods

Worlds can revolt if happiness goes below some threshold, destroying industry. I assume this reduces pollution increasing happiness, so it will equilibrate naturally.

- Angry: None
- Annoyed: Merchant
- Content: Merchant and Beacon
- Happy: Merchant, Beacon, and Blaster
- Ecstatic: No limitations

### World Colors

- Blue with Orange Border - Old Earth
- BrightOrange - Core

- Purple - Merchant
- Maroon - Beacon
- Orange - Stardock
- Red - Blaster

- Orange-red - Rich, 50% more build points
- Magenta - Poor, 50% less build points
- White - Normal, standard
- Orange Textured - Large - +20% Population, +1 all minerals
- Blue-Purple - Small - -20% Population
- Grey Smooth - Toxic - -60% Population, low industry

- Grey Textured - Faster Industry
- Khaki - Frigates
- Aqua - Corsairs
- Blue - Sloops
- Green - Stations

### World Minerals

> If you have none of a given mineral, you cannot build the corresponding ship, and if you have 3 of it you can build that ship at a quicker rate. 

Do the high mineral worlds correspond to the colored worlds above? What is a normal world's minerals? Rich world? Large world?

Notes:
- this Large world has 2 of all minerals and 3 of 2 minerals... which?
- this merchant world has 3 revidium/ranger and holds 4 merchants max
- merchant world with 1 revidium, 2 pladesium, 3 merchant max

- Pladesium: Sloops
- Stenterium: Stations
- Calastium: Corsairs
- Revidium: Rangers
- Frelenium: Frigates


### Anomalies

- Blue = slower
- Green = faster


## Early Strategy

### Fleet

Fleet ECM is an important factor, so emphasize rangers.

Fleets have a max size, but you won't hit it until you are harvesting worlds for fleets.

### Worlds

Cannot afford much early on, so really need to pump fleet build up! Stardock is a goal. So is stellurae, but not yet attainable.

Rangers are highly preferred thanks to their attack speed and ECM.

To build stations? It is relevant once you hit max world fleet. You need the ecm for defense against other players as well. I think it's definitely worth it.


#### Modern Strategy

Blaster worlds seem very highly powered, assuming they are a fleet multiplier. If the fleet limit is normal, then blaster is the endgame. Blaster is also useful at all stages since it augments fleet power at peak non/attrition, increasing conquest speed. However, every non-merchant world will increase fleet harvesting times.

Riffing on the classic strategy, we want to avoid pollution, so avoid building industry. It won't matter compared to merchants and stardocks.

I think early stardocks are very useful to half the fleet attrition with a cost of only 10 global facilities.

I also think that a template build based on fleet composition is the best option, stick to the long game.


##### Questions

- The population regulates what and how many global facilities you can build as well as how fast building goes.
- How much industry per pollution, how does pollution impact happiness?
- Is the max fleet size still present?
- Is industry with refinery worth it? It is a local facility.
  - Note the tradeoff is that stellurae is now a local facility.  Since Stellurae doesn't interfere with Merchant/Stardock strategy it may actually be worth it instead of industry+refinery.


#### Classic Strategy

focus on building tons of merchants so you can harvest your worlds. Ignore everything else. Fleet build balance is based exclusively on max fleet size.

Eventually your fleet attrition will be high, then start balancing in Stardocks. 

Build some beacons early as you want to reap the benefits of fast travel early. Sometimes you need to remove beacons to avoid navigation problems.

Avoid stardarts.


## Global Facilities

1. Classic: focus on building tons of merchants so you can harvest your worlds. Ignore everything else.


## Notes & Anecdata

- An early large world that I added full industry+factory to is Happy and producing several hundred guns after a wait. Even though pollution is severe, happiness is only very slowly going down, making it worth it for early harvest. 
    - TAKEAWAY: focus on large worlds early
- Worlds used to become more populated as approaching Old Earth, still true? If so focus on going that direction, as population affects global facilities on special worlds.
- Large world with max industry and a factory is losing happiness to pollution, but at the beginning I can't build enough "storage" build for a refinery to reduce pollution so I will try an amenity facility to keep them happy... but I can't seem to get to 8000 either, I may abandon the world and try some without industry to get fleet build up.
- Looks like merchants increase world build by a percentage, is it flat per merchant? That makes it kind of interesting rather than a flat value, since world build can be quite low without industry or factories. So this incentivizes me to build industry and factories.
