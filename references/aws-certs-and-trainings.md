A redux for navigating the world of AWS certification.

[Canonical Certification Resource](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)

[Certification Benefits](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/benefits/)

## Learning Paths

Optional "foundational certification": [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)

[Certification FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/faqs/)


- There are 4 learning paths
	- Cloud Practitioner (foundational)
	- Solutions Architect
	- Developer
	- Operations


## Associate Level Certificates

1. [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
1. [AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/)
1. [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)


## Other Certificates

Check the [available certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)

There are no prerequisites for any certificates.

- Currently there are the following quantity of certificates: 
	- 1 foundational
	- 3 associate
	- 2 professional
	- 5 specialty

## Recertification

Certificates are valid for 3 years, recertification is apparently half price.

[professional recertifications also cover the associate certificate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/recertification/?nav=tc&loc=4) for the learning path path.

It isn't clear -- it looks like the "Devops Engineer - Professional" certificate renews either, or both, `SysOps Administrator - Associate` and `Developer - Associate` certificates.  Is it either or is it both?
