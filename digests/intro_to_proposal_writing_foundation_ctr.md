## The Proposal Writing Process


1. Planning
    - what do you need the money for?
1. Research
    - who will you approach
1. Writing
    - how you put it all together?
1. Followup
    - what you do once a decision has been made?


### Planning


#### Do you have enough time?

Not a quick fix, 6-9 months between beginning proposal and receiving funds.


#### What are you asking for?

What kind of support: operations, project, building renovation, equipment.

Generating a Project Proposal is our focus today


### Research

Finding the right fit.

1. How does what you do fit with the funder's interests?
1. The `why` is just as important as the `who`
    - Tell them how your project achieves their goals, mission, and priorities.
    - Through a combination of your program and their resources.


### Writing the Proposal

Grantwriters are moving to online formats. Limited space and character restrictions.

Always follow the funder's guidelines.

Put together a `master proposal` or `base proposal` using the format we are about to go over.

There is a directory of common form grants on the [Foundation Center Knowledge Base website](https://grantspace.org).


### Four Typical Proposal Elements


#### Executive Summary

How do I reduce everything to one page? Extract the key information from the full proposal (write the full proposal first).

They will look at this first to determine if they want to read the rest of the proposal. May not continue reading if they are not interested right away.

Also used to present your project to the foundation board for consideration.

This can be used for the `letter of inquiry` as well.


##### Includes:

1. Statement of Need
1. Brief description project incl goals and objectives
1. Information about your objectives
1. How much money you are asking for


#### Narrative



##### Statement of Need

1. What specific need are you addressing?
    - fits size and scale of your solution
1. What audience and community are you serving?
1. What evidence do you have to support the need?


##### Project Description

1. What are you trying to achieve?
    - Your outcomes must be measurable
1. SMART Goals
    - Specific
    - Measurable
    - Achievable
    - Realistic
    - Time-based
1. What is your specific plan? Your proposal is your `organizing plan`.
    - Who will do the work? Both paid and volunteer.
    - What?
    - When?
    - Where?
    - Why?
    - How?
1. Evaluation: How do you know you are successful?
    - Specify program objectives in measurable terms
    - Identify key indicators of success
    - Outline data collection and analysis activites
    - Develop a TIMELINE to monitor the success of the program on an ongoing basis
    - What you will do with your information
1. TRACY - Tools and Reseources for Measuring Social Impact (or something like that, i may have mistyped)
1. Why are you the best organization to do this work?
    



##### Organization


##### Information

Follow the funder's guidelines.

Include everything (and very little of anything else).

For online applications it's ok to add links where possible.

- IRS Form 990
- Current Operating Budget and last year's budget versus actual
- List of board of director names and professional affiliation

    - People carrying out your project have sufficient knowledge and experience for success 


#### Other Stuff

- Grant is the beginning of the relationship with your funder
    - Regular reports, keep them informed!
    - Significant accomplishment? Send a note or make a phone call.
    - Having an event? Invite them as a courtesy no matter what, even if you know they cannot or will not go.


#### Follow Up

- It's not personal
- Find out why
- Ask about future funding
- Don't just put them on your generic mailing list! Keep them up to date


#### Key Takeaways
