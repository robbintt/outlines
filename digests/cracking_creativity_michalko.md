# Cracking Creativity

My condensed notes and summaries.


## Intro / Overview

The book presents thinking strategies of creative giants from: science, arts, industry.

**Advice: Find excellent mentors.  It is obvious that creative geniuses successfully transmitted their genius. Fermi's students had 6 nobel prize winners. Bohr's students had 4 nobel prize winners.**


### Productive Thinking First (stop using reproductive thinking)

Feynman proposed schools should teach productive thinking instead of reproductive thinking.

- **Productive Thinking:** Creative. Generate as many approaches as you can no matter how likely. look for all the possible needles by dissecting the haystack.
- **Reproductive Thinking:** Not creative. Rehash your experience into solutions. Rigid and narrow. Not competitive, others already thought of it.


### Idea Goals: Quantify and Qualify

- **Be Productive:** Geniuses set concrete numeric goals for their ideas in the short term. Writers set quotas for writing, Edison set goals for small (1 per 10 days) and big inventions (1 per 6 months).
- **Blind Variations:** Produce original and novel variations. **This is the core principle.**


### Selecting Ideas to Invest Time Into

- Within the mileu of ideas, let natural selection make choices. Evolution finds novel paths with a fitness algorithm. 
- **What is the fitness algorithm for our ideas?** I suspect the book to be light on this topic.
- Place to dig deeper on my own?

### Practice, Practice, Practice (Productive Thinking)

Organize your thinking by practicing these 9 strategies. Without practice, you will get no benefit.


### Intro Summaries

These are summaries of the intro, not the whole book.


#### Part 1: Seeing what no one else is seeing.

1. Knowing How to See
  - Use many unrelated perspectives to reimagine a problem
  - Don't just solve the existing problem, invent new problems and improve the problem space
  - Trent: I often find that the solution is obvious if I use my practical skills to enrich the question space
  - Define new problems as necessary even if they don't seem related.
2. Making Your Thought Visible
  - Use diagrams, mock ups, anything to break out of written and verbal (away from language, math, dialogue)
  - Formulate the subject as many ways as possible, especially with diagrams


#### Part 2: Thinking What No One Else is Thinking

Strategy 1 is used to produce a quantity of ideas.

Strategies 2-6 are for getting "blind variations" demonstrate how to incorporate chance and randomness to destabilize existing patterns of thinking and reorganize thoughts in new ways.

Strategy 7 is "conditions for effective group brainstorming" and "a selection of world class brainstorm techniques".


1. Thinking Fluently
  - **The most respected scientists produced the most GREAT works -and- the most BAD works.**
  - Geniuses produce. Period.
  - Edison had invention quotas: small every 10 days, large every 6 months
  - Bach wrote a Cantana per week, even when exhausted
  - Einstein produced 248+ papers
  - Writers have daily writing quotas, trent: see john steinbeck and stephen king
2. Making Novel Combinations
  - "Combinatory Play"  - Einstein's self-proclaimed essential feature in productive thought.
  - Form more novel combinations than anyone else.
  - Constantly combine and recombine from a large pool of parts (like legos)
  - The more you do the more success you will have. Go quickly and thoroughly.
  - Also use your subconscious (diffuse mode) by switching between different idea spaces then entering diffuse mode (meditation, sleep, eating, talking, physical labor, resting, exercise)
3. Connecting the Unconnected
  - Force completely unrealistic connections, see where they work, repeat. The winners will come out.
  - Tesla: the sun aroud the earth and the AC motor (magnet rotates). - example of zany idea yielding creative outcome
  - Da Vinci: The sound of a bell and a stone hitting water (visual & auditory waves)
4. Looking at the Other Side
  - David Bohm: Tolerate ambivalence between opposite or incompatible subjects
  - Niels Bohr: if you hold opposites together, you suspend your thought and your mind moves to a new level
  - Niels Bohr imagined light as both a particle and a wave (incompatible, yet it is still true)
5. Looking in Other Worlds
  - Analogies between unrelated systems
  - Inspiration from toys and nature
6. Finding What You Are Not Looking For
  - First principle of the **Creative Accident**
  - Answering the question in a novel, unexpected way is **the essential creative act**
  - B.F. Skinner's first principle for scientific methodologists: "When you find something interesting, drop everything and study it."
  - Drop your preconcieved plan with conviction and study the new thing.

7. Awakening the Collaborative Spirit
  - Principles and conditions for participants to retain their individuality while combining their efforts and talents in a group in ways vital for collaborative synthesis.
  - Collegial. Open & honest collaboration.
