### Project IceStorm

> Project IceStorm aims at reverse engineering and documenting the bitstream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bitstream files. The IceStorm flow (Yosys, Arachne-pnr, and IceStorm) is a fully open source Verilog-to-Bitstream flow for iCE40 FPGAs.
> The focus of the project is on the iCE40 LP/HX 1K/4K/8K chips. (Most of the work was done on HX1K-TQ144 and HX8K-CT256 parts.)
