### A collection of vim tricks. For `.vimrc`, see `.dotfiles`

Vim tricks are added here in order of need. A trick not often referenced should be at the bottom.

#### Buffers

- `:tabnew` - open a new empty buffer
- `:edit <filename>` - open <filename> in a new buffer
- `:buffers`, `:ls` - show open buffers
- `:buffer 1`, `:bu 1` - go to buffer 1
- `:buffer <substring>` - go to buffer that matches substring (press tab to complete)
- `:bd 1` - close buffer  
- `:w` - write buffer
