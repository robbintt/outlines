## info pages

info pages are like man pages. They apparently have hypertext before web type hyperlinks, and are emacs style documentation.

Henner says info pages are good references for C.

I should probably read all of `coreutils.info` and `info info`


### FUTURE

Take notes on `info info` and include below.


### Running `info`

Info can be used a few different ways

- `info` to get the directory root node for info files.
- `info printf` to get info on the node "printf".
- `info --apropos="printf" to search for "printf" on all nodes of all info pages on the info page path.


### Navigation

- `space`: page down
    - Also carries you to the next node regardless of level
- `backspace`: page up
    - Also carries you to the previous node regardless of level
- `b`: go to the top of the current node
- `C-l`: redraw the page (control-L)
- `?`: open a quick reference (close it with `C-x 0`)
- `[`: go to the next node in the current document
- `]`: go to the previous node in the current document
- `n`: go to the next node at the same level in the current document
- `p`: go to the previous node at the same level in the current document
- `u`: go the parent node
- `l`: go to the last node
- follow a link: move cursor over a link, a word preceded by an asterisk, press enter
- `q`: quit
- `m`: go to the menu item you write if it exists
    - Try searching for a menu to quickly find the menu's options?
- `f Cross`: follow a cross-reference starting with 'Cross'
    - `f?`: fetch a list of cross references for the current node
    - `C-g`: give up when fetching cross references (instead of typing one of the options)
    - a cross reference can lead to another manual, even on a remote machine
- `i Cross`: automate - go to index for info manual, search node for 'Cross', and go there
- `d`: go to the directory
- `t`: go to the top node in a manual
- `n n`: go directly to **info for experts**


#### Using vi type keybindings

- `$ info --vi-keys printf`: use vi type keybindings
    - FUTURE: map out exactly what varies between standard nav and vi mode


### Notes from `info info`

Many notes on `info info` are integrated elsewhere in this outline.

The `?` reference is very large and worth further study.

info calls its hyperlinks `Cross References`.

Check out the 'info for experts' section by typing `n n` or type `d i` and type 'Advanced'.


### Notes from `man info`

Notes on `man info` are integrated elsewhere in this outline.

`info coreutils printf`: get printf in coreutils (if there are more than one printf files)

I read that there are some flags to store and restore keystrokes pressed in an info file.
