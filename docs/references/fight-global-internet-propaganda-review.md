# Fighting Global Internet Propaganda Review

Some people are fighting online trolls as a team online, essentially as a campaign.

This is some information about this movement.


## Intentions of Propaganda

This section could use some well researched information, but there are some obvious ones:

1. Remove thoughtful people from the political process
1. Polarize the political process to create deeper fractures in ideology
1. Overfocus people on literally anything
	- prevent them from seeing the big picture
1. Appeal to emotion
1. Apply self-consistency logic (you agree to this, therefore you must agree to that)
	- Self consistency is the primary driver for human motivation.

## Primary Targets for Propaganda

- reddit
- twitter
- facebook


## Potential Tactics for Distributing Propaganda

1. Networks of trolls with simulated traffic
	- 'record and playback' real account activity using real network topography as a template to evade detection
	- build many disjoint layers of fake networks that can be activated for particular purposes
1. Recruit vulnerable people
	- identify more intimate online forums for people seeking more personal attention: 4chan, something awful
		- create new online forums to cultivate this: 
		- voat, gab, PewTube, WrongThink, Infogalactic, GoyFundMe, wasp.love
		- "The Alt-Right Created a Parallel Internet. It's an unholy mess." - [NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/technology/alt-right-internet.html)
	- misdirected people can exert influence on real social networks
	- viral sharing is already addictive
	- use narrative storytelling to move people further than the mainstream pool of facts

## Twitter banned 70 million accounts

- How do bots still exert influence over twitter after this?
- Twitter has 336 million monthly active users (MAU). So this means 20% of accounts were banned?  
- Or is there a massive network of inactives, or is it a problem with the trending algorithm?
