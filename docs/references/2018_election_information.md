# 2018 Election Information

How do I best reduce which elections exist in all USA governments in 2018?



## Census of Governments (COG): [https://www.census.gov/govs](https://www.census.gov/govs)

A census of governments is run by the US federal government every 5 years, in years ending in `2` and `7`.

I will be using derivative data sources, so this may not be used, or may be used to validate completeness.

Each government is assigned a GID, the [2007 GID lookup is here](https://harvester.census.gov/GID/MainPage.aspx).

The 2017 COG is [expected to conclude in September 2018](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/cog.html).

Code for America has [outlined a project attempting to work with this data](https://github.com/codeforamerica/project-ideas/issues/60), and may still be working with this.


## Wikipedia historically keeps good records

For streaming changes, Wikipedia might be the best bet.

Biased view, but generally in my direction.  Has good data.
