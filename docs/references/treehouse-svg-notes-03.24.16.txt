Microsoft does not use SMIL and won't.
Chrome is planning to phase out SMIL.

snap.js, velocity.js, gsap.js javascript animation libraries.

two.js - another drawing library, this one can use canvas

SVG WordPress like a boss:

We can only animate inline svg with css.

CSS Transform Property: rotate, scale, skew, translate
The transition is then applied onto the transform for the class of the elements affected.

Give the SVG elements CSS classes and style those.

<g>...</g> element is a container for grouping SVG elements together. Add a CSS class to the <g> element to change all components as a group.

XML always has closing tags.

CSS transforms around 50% 50% (center)
SVG transforms around 0 0 (top left)
Use `transform-origin: 50% 50%;` to transform around the center.


Firefox "transform-origin bug": 
===============================
Firefox does not honor percentage based origins for SVG
Firefox doesn't recognize keyword based origins (right bottom or center center)
cx and cy in the circle SVG element have the circle center in 'pixels'
This is kinda weird since SVG doesn't have pixels, but the length is apparently relative to the whole SVG.
transform-origin: 200px 50px;
