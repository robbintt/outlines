## BranchPythonOperator

There isn't very good documentation for this feature yet.


### Why?

The `BranchPythonOperator` is used to create control flow in a `DAG`.


#### Towards Automating Changes to Data

If there is unexpected input from a data source, then automate preprocessing the new data format so the automation can be improved.

NB: This type of branch would probably trigger another DAG.


### Inter-task communication

There are two options:

- `variables`
- `XComs`

Variables sit in a global `variables` object, where as `XComs` are pushed and pulled between tasks.

For task-to-task communication, we will use `XComs`.


#### Passing Context to `BranchPythonOperator`

`BranchPythonOperator` inherits from `PythonOperator` and is defined in the same module.  Both share use of `provide_context=True` as a keyword argument. If this is passed, the `python_callable` function must receive `**kwargs`.  The `context` includes `task_instance.xcom_pull` which pulls information from other tasks.




### Notes

Each branch must point to a task; if there isn't anything to do, use a `DummyOperator`.

- [TaskInstance.xcom_pull](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/code.html?highlight=taskinstance#airflow.models.TaskInstance) 
	- `BaseOperator.xcom_pull` imports `TaskInstance.xcom_pull` from `context`
    - You must pass `key=None` or any desired key/value to get tasks that are from `xcom_push`
    - By default tasks from `xcom_push` are ignored
