# Meditations - Marcus Aurelius

Some things that stood out to me


## Book 1

He gives a lot of things he has lived by

- Spend liberally on private trainings at home
- Work with your own hands
- Be happy with a plank bed and hide covering and whatever goes with a greek discipline
- Write letters in a simple style
- If someone offends you, be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled
- from appolonious 
	- I learnt freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose, and to take no other viewpoint, even for a moment, but that of reason
	- to see clearly (trent: a.k.a. "to reason") on all occasions whether it be extreme pain, the loss of a child, or long illness
	- be most resolute and yielding
	- receive favors without letting them go unnoticed or being put in an awkward position
- correct people's language later by example without bringing specific attention to their mistake
- never say to anyone "that you have no time" or allege "you have urgent business to attend to"
- thankful that he did not fall into the hands of sophists when he became interested in philosophy, waste his time on observing the movements of the heavens, literature, and intellectual puzzles, "for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune"


## Book 2 (chapter 5)
