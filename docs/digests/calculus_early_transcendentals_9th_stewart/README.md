# Notes on Calculus - Early Transcendentals 9th Ed. by Stewart

The 8th edition is the first book recommended by [https://www.susanrigetti.com/math](https://www.susanrigetti.com/math). However, there is a 9th edition so I got that.

## How to Study by Susan Rigetti:

I learn the same way as Susan and hope to use LaTeX a lot, but may use a blend based on learning facility with or without tech in the loop.

> Every person learns in their own special way, and knowing your learning style is important: do you learn by reading, by taking notes, by talking, by watching, by doing, or by a combination of some or all of these? For example, I learn by reading and by note-taking, so I read through textbooks very carefully, take copious notes, and summarize each concept in my own words before moving on to something new. Think about this before you begin so that you'll know how to structure your studies. 

> Regardless of your learning style, you'll still need to solve the problems in each textbook. Just like in physics, solving problems is the only way to understand mathematics. There's no way around it. 

> One tough thing about learning on your own is that you may not know whether you are solving the problems correctly. A number of the textbooks listed below have answers to selected exercises in the back of the book, but these aren’t always adequate for two reasons: (1) they often only show the solutions to the problems, and not the steps taken to get there; and (2) it’s much better to do all of the exercises rather than just a select few. The good news is that many of the solutions (and step-by-step ways to solve them) can be found online with a simple google search. If you are going to google the answers, however, please first try to solve the problems on your own, and try multiple times (you’re not in school trying to get a perfect grade — you’re trying to learn and understand).


## Notes & Assignments with LaTeX

It is [strongly recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pc11w/can_i_use_my_graphics_tablet_for_math_homework/c3o7njk/?newUser=true) that I take notes using LaTeX.

Supposedly I can learn enough LaTeX in an afternoon using the [LaTeX/Basics wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics)

I hope github displays latex visually, I will have to test it.

### Vim+LaTeX == lervag/vimtex

- [A Complete Guide on Writing LaTeX with Vimtex in Neovim](https://jdhao.github.io/2019/03/26/nvim_latex_write_preview/)
- Use the help in vim:
  - `:h vimtex-completion`
  - `:h vimtex-default-mappings`

### LaTeX Resources

I'm planning to work with vim-tex, but am interested in trying gui editors potentially. The integrated skim viewer is a lot like my old macdown workflow so I am excited about it.

## Versions

I am reading these and bookmarking them on the kindle app to save bookmarks temporarily between devices using kindle. I suspect all important notes will not require these bookmarks and they are just for convenience.
