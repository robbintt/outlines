##### Outcomes:

- This paper generates __language__ for approaching the H-LAM/T system. Does it give methodology or artifacts?
- Is it my job to keep generating __language__ and start building __artifacts__ and __methodology__ to continue amplifying our intelligence?  
- Are computers sufficient? Do we write computer programs for 500 years now, progressively generating __language__ and automating more __metholology__ as we spike off as more abstract beings?
- This paper wants to "automate external symbol manipulation" - in other words it wants to build giant trees of language which are used to uncover new language.  See section on language.

## Augmenting Human Intellect: 

#####Abstract:

"This is an initial summary report of a project taking a new and systematic approach to improving the intellectual effectiveness of the individual human being. A detailed conceptual framekwork explores the nature of the system composed of the individual and the tools, concepts, and methods that match his basic capabilities to his problems. One of the tools that shows the greatest immediate promise is the computer, when it can be harnessed for direct on-line assistance, integrated with new concepts and methods.



### Part I - Introduction

1. Part 1A - General ( "Terms and Definitions" )
    1. Augmenting Human Intellect = "Increasing a human's ability to..."
        1. Approach a complex problem situation
        2. Gain comprehension to suit his needs
        3. Derive solutions to problem
    2. Increased Capabilities 
        - "Faster, better, beyond original capabilities"
    3. Complex Situations = "Professional Problems"
        - Problem scale is __20 minutes__ to __20 years__
    4. Means 
        - extensions of native sensory, motor, and mental capabilities
    5. Improvement Space 
        - Visualize this extending from/with the __H-LAM/T Capability Space__
        - Will cover in section 2


2. Part 1B - Objective of the Study
    1. Find: factors that limit effectiveness of the individual's __basic information-handling capabilities__ in meeting society's needs for problem solving in its most general sense
    2. Develop: Techniques, Procedures, Systems - "which better match these __basic capabilities__ to the needs, problems, and progress of society"
    3. Specifications:
        1. Both long- and short-term research goals in augmentation
        2. Specific actions in:
            1. Work Environment
            2. Thinking
            3. Skills
            4. Methods of working
        3. Framework is a basis for: 
            1. evaluating possible relevance of work/knowledge from existing fields 
            2. assimilate relevant things from those fields
                - "Not be in a vacuum of study"
    4. __Framework is a basis__ for choosing starting points
        - __reveal areas__ where research can be done
        - __develop methodologies__ for that research
    5. H-LAM/T Conceptual Framework is a "rudimentary framework" 
        - a place to start at and evolve from

### Part II - Conceptual Framework

1. Human has:
    - Motor channels: Transmit information
    - Sensory channels: Receive information
2. Human processing:
    - Conscious Processing
    - Unconscious Processing
3. Augmentation Means:
    1. Artifacts
    2. Language
    3. Methodology
        - Organization by methods, procedures, and strategies
    4. Training
4. "Process Hierarchies"
    - Structure / Organization of __each tiny step__
5. "Augmentation Means"
    - Serve to break down __complex problems__ to __tiny steps__
    - "__tiny step__" = "sub-process"
6. There is no way to "find the bottom" of the subprocess tree
    - It is not necessary to start at the bottom
    - A "simple enough" bottom layer will do
        - Does Engelbart mean simple enough to describe wholly or pragmatically? May not matter.
7. Begin from __basic capabilities__:
    1. Sensory-Mental-Motor Process Capabilities
    2. Add process capabilities of Artifacts
8. Each individual has their own repertoire of process __capabilities__ which are selected and adapted for execution on a process
9. A person and his/her artifacts can be said to have a "toolkit" called a __repertoire hierarchy__ which extends from his __basic capabilities__
10. __3 categories__ of __process capability__:
    1. Explicit-Human
    2. Explicit-Artifact
    3. Composite (Human to Artifact Interface)
11. H-LAM/T System - Definition
    - Human using 
    - Language, Artifacts, and Methodology in which 
    - he is Trained
12. H/LAM-T System - Terms
    1. has the __capability__ and
    2. uses the __repertoire__ to
    3. perform the __process__
13. __Executive processes__ embody all __methodology__ of H/LAM-T System.
    - Habit
    - Strategy
    - Rules of Thumb
    - Prejudice
    - __Learned Method__ - NOTE: implies training is contained in methodology?
    - Intuition
    - Unconscious Dictates
14. NOTE: Methodology is enumerated above, which leaves only artifacts and language.
    - Is this collection (and any similar extensions) along with artifacts, language enough to embody all interactions a human has with his substrate?
    - Language evolves around systems. Uncovering new systems will resolve new language.
    - What is training then? It seems to be a subset of method but is included in the acronym.
    - Maybe training is intended to be an extension of methods but as a special and critical process for onboarding __process capabilities__ in humans (viewing a human as an artifact as well).
    - There is an analogy Engelbart uses between humans and artifacts, both containing __repertoire hierarchies__ of __process capabilities__. An artifact is generally designed to execute a __process capability__. A human can be trained to execute a __process capability__.
15. A new innovation ripples/propagates both up and down the __capability hierarchy__.
16. "Synthesis"
    - New capabilities from old capabiltiies. Calls for a __systems engineering__ approach.
    - "Synergy and Synthesis" - Use metal allow tensile strength analogy to understand how organizing some capabilities can create a __radical__ new "synthetic capability"
        - NOTE: This is cribbed BY __Buckminster Fuller__'s "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth". Engelbart was first unless it can be found in an earlier work. Regardless, the idea of alloys having complex new properties is potent.  The world still has magic and it is materials engineering.
        - NOTE: It would be nice to have analogies other than materials engineering otherwise we should all just become materials engineers...
17. __capabilities__ are "changeable parts"
    - When changed, capabilities explose latent "synthetic capabilities" in that "repertoire hierarchy"
    - His idea: by changing interchangeable parts, "__side reactions__" or __new capabilities__ can be unearthed.
    - An internal definition for what we call inventing by benevolent mistakes in experiment.
18. Consider the whole H-LAM/T System as an ongoing experiment.
    - NOTE: All humanity is in a __PERMANENT__, __UNIFIED__ experiment. All action is data.
    - Gather data as such (on the interactions in the system)
    - some data targets: capabilities, effectiveness, etc.
19. As humans have added tools, our common/shared repertoire hierarchies have grown and formed around us.  Radical change is the norm.
    - __Can we accelerate radical change with guided research?__
20. "Intelligence Amplifier"
    - Does __not__ imply increasing raw intelligence.
    - An amplifier makes louder what is already there.
    - We seek to amplify intelligence by restructuring the H-LAM/T System.
        - NOTE: He doesn't say repertoire hierarchies here, he says restructure the whole system.
        - NOTE: His hooks for restructure are Language, Artifacts, Methods (including Training).
        - NOTE: So what does he focus on?
            - We could do: 
                - automation - move more and more trained methods into artifacts
                - science - create and apply new models and language (math?) to describe the universe
                - applications engineering - human methods seems like the weakest part of H-LAM/T... get a human to do more complex techniques
                    - Unless we are __already down this rabbit hole__ and people increasingly program complex capabilities into dynamic artifacts right now
21. NOTE: Often H/LAM-T will exist natively in a poorly built and/or poorly maintained state.  Retraining may be 80% of the value of amplification.... sometimes.
22. LAM-T Augmentation means represent the amplifier:
    - Simplified using Doug's definitions: "The means by which we augment LAM-T are the amplifier"
    - Simplified more: "The means are the amplifier"
23. Man-Artifact Interface:
    - NOTE: Human-Computer Interaction is the field today.
    - This term is derived from industrial revolution term "man-machine interface"
    - Two Domains:
        1. Human
        2. Artifact
    - Explicit-Human processes often exchange across an __interface__ to Explicit-Artifact processes
    - __Composite Processes__ - often designed solely for a functional match, "coupling", between the __explicit processes__.
24. Language evolves to a situation
    - Language can force its users down a way of thinking. Language does exert a force on its own evolution.
    - NOTE: Language evolves to describe new concepts, which is a form of mental modeling of phenomena which can reveal new capabilities and thus contribute to novel processes. 
    - NOTE: Human-Language aided thought generates new ways of thinking, new methods, and new processes. These can later be trained or incorporated in artifacts.
    - Capabilities drive actions and drive language evolution
    - __"We offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian Hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and the capability for effective intellectual activity, are directly affected during their evolution by the means by which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols."__
    - "Automated external symbol manipulation" - Synmbols which humans represents concepts he is manipulating can be rearranged before his eyes. Essentially giant trees of words and concepts that can uncover new language automatically by processing the base concepts of current language.
    - Note that in the next paragraph, Doug predicts the action of using google on a smartphone to search a term in real time.  To some degree we are already living in a much more fluid-language world.
    - Question: How would having a complete, fast dictionary impact language evolution?
        - NOTE: See encyclopedia dramatica, urban dictionary.  People try to redefine things to what they want them to mean all the time, today. Terminology enters the zeitgeist very quickly but fades as quickly and terms often have different meanings to different clades. See: "Safe Space", 2016 representations and attacks. Organizations have to maintain internal definitions to be able to communicate.
25. Two points in designing new repertoire hierarchies:
    1. Materials - fundamental capabilities from which all others must be constructed.
        1. Decomposition Search 
            - Decompose capabilities to discover new materials (see: synthetic capabilities)   
        2. De Novo - e.g. Materials Engineering (other analogies?)
    2. Principles - Structures, explicitly __synergetic structures__
        - "synergism" used by biologists and physicists for a siimilar concept:
            - Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (quote from paper): "...cooperative action of discrete agencies such that the total effect is greater than the sum of the two effects taken independently..."
        - Synergy is important because it is the threshold beyond which the means become greater than the sum of their materials.
        - Five tentative types of structure:
            1. Mental
            2. Concept
            3. Symbol
            4. Process
            5. Physical   
    3. Human contributes many types of capability... "wears many hats"
    4. A complex capability has two classes of capability (NOTE: manager vs employee)
        1. Executive class
        2. Direct contributive class
    5. Repertoire Hierarchy (sic)
        - A mountain of white collar talent that sits atop and controls the talens of the "workers"
        - Goal: Maximize productivity, Gain comprehension, Solve problems.
        - Engelbart sees the production work as a flat base layer with a pyramid of white collar talent on top
        - "Theorem" - We could expect significant gains from improving __symbol__ and __process__ structuring.
    6. Finding: Humans switch frequently between one symbol structure and another continuously.
    7. "Human Augmentation Means" will require:
        - Training
        - Mental Tricks
        - Improved Language
        - New Methodology
        - "Unconscious Processes may be important"
    8. A human should be able to draw on explicit artifact capabilities at many levels in the process hierarchy
