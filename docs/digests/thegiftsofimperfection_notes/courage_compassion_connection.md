# Courage, Compassion, Connection

- practice worthiness
  - courage - we get courage when we do courageous acts, it's a "habitus", habit.
  - compassion - also a habit, get it by doing it.
  - connection - also a habit, get it by doing it.


- if you feel ashamed:
  - tell your story - empathic person - it must have been hard, you were brave
    - listen and be with us and our emotion
    - deeply rooted, able to bend
    - embraces our strengths and struggles
    - earned the right to hear it
  - 8 responses "empathy misses" to avoid, and also don't do these things:
    - avoid someone who would say "i feel sorry for you" - sympathy
      - make someone ashamed feel even worse "you poor thing, bless your heart"
    - avoid judgment - someone who feels shame for you and confirms your behavior
      - you have to try to make them feel better
    - avoid disappointment person "you let me down"
      - wtf behavior, like a parent response
    - discomfort - terrible, who can we blame
      - discharge the shame, blame someone else
    - comparing and competing
      - confuse connection with opportunity to one up you
    - advice giving and problem solving
      - i can fix this and i can fix you
      - instict is to fix it
      - especially for people who are a resource for problem solving


- identifying courageousness
  - for yourself
  - trent: i could also use this to give positive feedback (example from book of mother positive feedback to daughter)
  - courage has a ripple effect, everytime we demonstrate it we make the world kinder and braver


- compassion
  - TODO
  - be with as an equal
- boundaries and compassion:
  - barriers to compassion practice - fear of setting boundaries and holding people accountable
  - understanding connection between boundaries, accountability, acceptance, and compassion has made author kinder
  - before the breakdown: judgmental, resentful, angrier on inside, sweeter on outside
  - after the breakdown: genuinely more compassionate, less judgmental and resentful, way more serious about boundaries. I have no idea what it looks like on the outside (e.g. not as sweet? doesn't matter), but feels way better on the inside
  - boundary conscious people were most compassionate
  - compassionate people are boundaried people
  - start compassion by setting boundaries and holding people accountable
  - we live in a blame culture
    - can we be kinder but firmer?
    - less blame, more accountability
    - shame and blame without accountability is toxic
      - move the focus from the original behavior to your own behavior
      - the only behavior in question is the person shaming someone else
    - for your kids: if you don't clean up after yourself, then i won't be as happy in my home
  - separate the behavior from the person. what they are doing, not who they are

- connection
  - connection is energy that exists between people when:
    - they feel seen, heard, and valued
    - they can give and receive without judgment
    - they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship
  - connection is required for humans, it's not negotiable, "it's neuroscience"
  - the more stronger we are connected emotionally, the greater the mutual force
  - let go of "myth of self sufficency"
    - let go of the idea of success as not needing anyone
    - don't confuse communication with connection, especially digital communication
  - "until we receive with an open heart, we can never give with an open heart"
    - when we attach judgement to receiving help, we attach judgment to giving help
    - do you derive self worth from never needing help and always offering it?
