- Use mental tools and tricks to inspire and motivate yourself

## Procrastination

- **These strategies are more important than you think**
- Understand psychology of procrastination 
- Good learning is a "brick by brick" activity
	- Procrastination is the #1 blocker


## Why not use Willpower

- Hard to come by
- Uses lots of mental resources
- **Don't need to waste on procrastination**


## Why procrastination?

- Unhappy feeling lights up pain centers of the brain..
- Avoidance makes you feel better temporarily
- Shares features with addiction
	- Temporary relief from reality e.g. surfing the web
- telling yourself false stories:
	- i don't have good spacial reasoning
	- if i study too far ahead i will forget the material
	- belief that procrastination is "an innate characteristic"


## Chunking is related to "Habit"

- Habit allows us to free our mind for other things
	- Zombie mode so we can focus on other things
- Habits can be brief or long


### 4 Parts of a habit

Neither helpful or harmful innately.

Engineer the cue and reward. Update the belief on a plan.  The routine will fall away

1. The Cue
	- Seeing a todo list item, time to do some tasks
	- Seeing a text message from a friend, time to stop work
2. The Routine
	- picking up your phone to read the news after waking up
	- zombie responses
3. The Reward
	- Find a way to reward yourself for good habits
	- Find a way to remove the reward for bad habits
	- Procrastination: Moving your mind's focus to something more pleasant
		- The reward is quick and easy
4. The Belief
	- Habits have power because of your belief in them
	- To change a habit, change your underlying belief


## Build a habit: focus on process

- To build a habit: Focus on process, not product
	- product is "outcome"
- Easiest way is to do a pomodoro
	- Mind can march mindlessly along

### Tips
- use a quiet space or noise cancelling headphones
- Usually you will have some negative feelings about beginning a learning session
	- Non procrastinators use "self talk" to get past the negative feelings and get started: "just get on with it"
- Focus on process, not product: "I'm going to spend 20 minutes working"
- Product is an outcome: "I'm going to finish my homework."


## Overwriting An Old Habit

Change your reaction to a specific "cue".

The only place to apply willpower is changing your reaction to a "cue".

### The Cue (4 kinds)

Action: "Recognize" what launches you into zombie procrastination mode.

1. Location
2. Time
3. How you feel
4. Reactions


### The Routine

Action: "Engineer the routine". This is the reaction point where you must actively focus on rewiring your old habit.

Write a plan for the routine. It may not work perfectly. Adjust as necessary and celebrate the victories when your plan works.

- Put your cellphone in an unreachable place
- Use the pomodoro technique


### Reward

- Investigate what is happening.
	- Why are you procrastinating?
	- Can you substitute an emotional payoff? A feeling of pride or satisfaction?
	- Can you win a small internal bet or contest?
	- Indulge in a latte or read a favorite website
	- Watch TV or read on the web without guilt for an evening
	- Go out for a movie, buy a sweater or other frivolous purchase
	- A reward can overcome previous cravings
	- Your brain will rewire when it begins to "EXPECT THE REWARD"

- Tips
	- Stopping at 5 PM gives a mini deadline that spurs work
		- Stopping is a nice reward and ties into focus on process
	- It takes a few days of drudgery before flow starts to take hold
	- The better you get, the 


### Belief

- When the going gets stressful you long to fall into old, comforatable habits
- Belief that your system works will get you through
- Develop a new community
	- Virtually hang out with MOOC classmates


## Juggling Life & Learning

This lecture is a bit scattered, break it out into a nice diagram or outline.

- Once a week, write a weekly list of key tasks
- On each day write a list you can reasonably work on or accomplish
	- Otherwise they take up space on the edge of your working memory
- Action: Daily task list the evening before
	- This helps your diffuse mode to grapple with tasks to figure out how to accomplish them
- Most items are process oriented
- Only a few items are product oriented because they are very well quantified
- Sidetracked by email 
	- switch to pomodoro, a process orientation
	- 22 minute pomodoro I don't have to do the same thing every time
- Mixing up tasks keeps things fun and prevents unhealthy bouts of sitting
- Since I practice, I am good at gauging what I can do in a reasonable period
- Goal finish time for the day - 5 PM
	- Planning quitting time is as important as planning working time
	- Sometimes review your major work right before you sleep, diffuse mode working
	- Maintaining healthy leisure time will improve your work
	- No matter how busy your life is, you do need a bit of break
- Eat your frogs first in the morning
	- Action: Most disliked (and important) task, at least 1 pomodoro right when you start working
