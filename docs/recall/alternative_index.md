Alternative index is an idea from Maria Popova of brain picking.org. This comes from the 10th anniversary introduction to the gifts of imperfection by Brené Brown.

I think this is a useful strategy for organizing thoughts that are personally valuable into a book. This is the along the same being of my issue of what I actually get out of this book. This also aligns with the 10 10 10 rule for if you got something out of the book and 10 days, 10 months and 10 years.

It is annotations and notes. It takes time and I wonder the value against the time cost? which Books would benefit the most from an alternative index? 

This is another view of Audible bookmarks or dog earring a paper book so… I guess keep that in mind, although it might have some annotations on the index.

Since its centralized it may be easier to get back to something or do study/review, whereas dog – earring and audible bookmarks are out of sight out of mine
