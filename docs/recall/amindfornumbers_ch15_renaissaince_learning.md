The chapter is about how to learn on your own.

I guess the idea is "renaissance learners" are people who follow the old concept of "renaissance man" who know all subjects and have lots of capabilities. It is still admirable conceptually.


Many exceptionally successful people dropped out of college (although the examples generally had immediate financial incentives to leave and stable family wealth). I think the point still stands since they learned what they needed to before college, then became hyper focused on a separate incentive set, even with backup opportunities.

For learning, Persistence is more important than Intelligence.

People will undermine you. Competition can get dirty and is as common as cooperation. Practice maintaining a cool composure.

Great teachers create a great environment for learning... TODO what were the key points here?

Some people figure out their learning style then emphasize that. For example, the surgeon who emphasized books over his classes because he learned better that way.

I learn very very well from books as well. They are like a direct discussion with the author to me, although obviously I have to use other avenues if I can't ask myself and discover the answer.

Use teachers' time wisely. Avoid seeking an ego boost through communication with them. Avoid trying to prove why your convoluted answer is right and learn it their way first, then you can go back to messing with your convoluted way to see if it has merit (generally will not).
