# recall

These documents are my recall sessions from my learning.


## howto

How do I add a new doc to this folder?

1. Recall as much as possible.
2. Voice to text is fine
3. Format, spelling, etc. are not important or relevant
4. Save the changes

If you want to organize the knowledge, **don't** do it in this folder.

Don't add to a recall section later although it doesn't matter if you do. It's just not intended as a crystallized / polished store of knowledge.
