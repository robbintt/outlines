# Praxis: Increasing Happiness

From wikipedia: [Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

> Headey (2008) concluded that an internal locus of control (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) and having "positive" personality traits (notably low neuroticism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being.

> Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being.

> Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's disposable income (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction.

## Detailed Activities

### Solo CBT

robbintt@gpt-4 12> Is CBT a solo activity

CBT, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is traditionally a form of psychotherapy conducted with a licensed therapist. In this setting, it is not a solo activity, as you work together with the therapist to identify and address negative thought patterns and cognitive distortions.

However, there are also self-help resources and books available that teach CBT techniques that can be practiced individually. In this case, CBT can be considered a solo activity. Keep in mind that practicing CBT on your own may not be as effective as working with a trained professional, especially when addressing more severe mental health concerns.

In summary, CBT can be both a solo activity (using self-help resources) and a collaborative activity (working with a therapist). The choice depends on individual needs, preferences, and the severity of the issues being addressed.

robbintt@gpt-4 13> What is the research around solo cbt

Research on self-guided or solo Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown promising results. Several studies have found that self-help CBT interventions can be effective for treating various mental health conditions, particularly mild to moderate anxiety and depression.

A meta-analysis of 40 studies on self-help CBT interventions (Andersson & Cuijpers, 2009) showed that these interventions had a moderate effect size in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Another meta-analysis of 15 studies (Cuijpers et al., 2009) examining self-help interventions for depression found a moderate effect size as well.

It is important to note, however, that self-guided CBT may not be as effective as therapist-guided CBT for more severe mental health issues or complex cases. Additionally, self-help interventions may not provide the same level of support, personalization, and feedback as working with a trained professional.

Despite these limitations, self-guided CBT can be a useful option for individuals who may not have access to a therapist, cannot afford therapy, or prefer to work independently. It can be an accessible starting point for those seeking to improve their mental well-being.

### Mindfulness Meditation

Q: how do I do mindfulness meditation?

Mindfulness meditation is a practice that focuses on building awareness of the present moment and accepting it without judgment. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with mindfulness meditation:

1. Find a quiet space: Choose a location where you can sit or lie down comfortably without distractions or interruptions.

2. Set a timer: Decide on the duration of your meditation session, especially if you're a beginner. You can start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.

3. Choose a comfortable position: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, maintaining a relaxed but upright posture. You can sit cross-legged on the floor, on a cushion, or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground.

4. Close your eyes: Gently close your eyes or, if you prefer, maintain a soft gaze a few feet in front of you.

5. Focus on your breath: Pay attention to your natural breathing pattern. Observe the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. You don't need to change your breath, just be aware of it.

6. Accept wandering thoughts: It's normal for your mind to wander during meditation. When you notice your thoughts drifting, gently acknowledge them and bring your focus back to your breath without judgment. This process of noticing and refocusing is a key part of mindfulness meditation.

7. Use an anchor: If you find it difficult to focus on your breath, you can use an alternative anchor for your attention, such as a word, phrase, or mantra that you silently repeat to yourself.

8. Expand your awareness: As you become more comfortable with the practice, you can expand your focus to include other sensations or experiences in the present moment, such as sounds, bodily sensations, or emotions.

9. End your meditation: When your timer goes off or you feel ready to end your session, take a few moments to notice your surroundings and gradually bring your awareness back to the room. Gently open your eyes and take a few deep breaths before returning to your daily activities.

Remember, mindfulness meditation is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself and try to maintain a non-judgmental attitude towards your thoughts and experiences.

Q: Isn't there research about focusing on your breath?
