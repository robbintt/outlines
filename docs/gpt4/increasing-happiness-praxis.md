# Praxis: Increasing Happiness

From wikipedia: [Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

> Headey (2008) concluded that an internal locus of control (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) and having "positive" personality traits (notably low neuroticism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being.

> Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being.

> Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's disposable income (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction.

## Daily Happiness Checklist

Daily Happiness Checklist (Revised Order by Effectiveness)

1. Sleep Hygiene (7-9 hours)
   - Prioritize getting sufficient, quality sleep each night, as sleep is crucial for overall well-being and happiness. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule and establish a relaxing bedtime routine.

2. Physical Activity (30 minutes)
   - Engage in your preferred form of exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, yoga, or swimming) to boost mood and reduce stress.

3. Morning Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes)
   - Find a quiet space and spend time focusing on your breath or a mantra to start your day with a calm mind.

4. Social Connection (variable time)
   - Reach out to friends or family members through a phone call, text, or in-person visit to maintain and strengthen relationships.

5. Acts of Kindness (variable time)
   - Perform small acts of kindness for others, such as helping a neighbor, complimenting someone, or volunteering. This can boost happiness by promoting positive emotions and fostering social connections.

6. Time in Nature (15-30 minutes)
   - Spend time outdoors in natural settings, such as a park, forest, or beach. Exposure to nature has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and increase well-being.

7. Problem-Solving Practice (10-15 minutes)
   - Identify a challenge you are currently facing, brainstorm possible solutions, and take a small step toward resolving the issue.

8. Goal Review and Progress (5-10 minutes)

   - Recite affirmations that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors, promoting self-confidence and an internal locus of control.

10. Gratitude Journaling (10 minutes)
    - Write down three things you are grateful for each day to cultivate a positive mindset and increase happiness.

11. Laughter and Humor (variable time)
    - Make time to watch a funny movie, read a humorous book, or share jokes with friends. Laughter can reduce stress, improve mood, and promote feelings of happiness.

12. Deep Breathing Exercises (5-10 minutes)
    - Practice deep breathing exercises throughout the day to help manage stress and maintain a sense of calm.

13. Nurturing Hobbies (variable time)
    - Engage in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, such as painting, playing a musical instrument, gardening, or cooking.

14. Evening Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes)
    - Wind down with another session of mindfulness meditation, focusing on releasing any stress or tension from the day.

Please note that the effectiveness of each activity may vary depending on individual preferences and experiences. The revised order provided above takes into consideration the importance of certain items, but you should still adjust the checklist according to your personal needs and priorities.


## Reducing your "Neuroticism"

To reduce neuroticism:

1. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Alters thought patterns, reducing negative thinking associated with neuroticism.

2. Mindfulness: Reduces anxiety, promotes self-acceptance.

3. Physical Activity: Reduces stress, promotes mood stability.

4. Develop Coping Skills: Strategies to manage stress help mitigate neurotic reactions.


## Increase Your "Locus of Control"

1. Problem-Solving: Identify challenges, generate solutions, take action, reflect on the outcome.

2. Affirmations: Positive self-statements that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors.

3. Goal Setting: Long-term vision with short-term actionable steps promotes a sense of control.

4. Mindfulness: Practice staying present-focused rather than worrying about uncontrollable future events.


## Improving happiness set point involves psychological interventions

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): It focuses on changing thought patterns. Negative thoughts can drag down your happiness set point.

2. Mindfulness Meditation: Regular practice can increase baseline happiness, as it helps reduce stress and promote relaxation.

3. Regular Exercise: It can release chemicals called endorphins which can make you feel happier.

4. Maintain Social Connections: Strong, positive relationships are essential for happiness.

5. Practice Gratitude: Reflecting on positive experiences can boost happiness levels.

Rubric: Evidence based (1-3 points), applicability (1-3 points), detail level (1-3 points).

Overall, I am fairly confident in these recommendations based on scientific literature. However, individual experiences can vary.
