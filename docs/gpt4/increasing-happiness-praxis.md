# Praxis: Increasing Happiness

From wikipedia: [Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

> Headey (2008) concluded that an internal locus of control (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) and having "positive" personality traits (notably low neuroticism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being.

> Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being.

> Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's disposable income (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction.

## Reducing your "Neuroticism"

To reduce neuroticism:

1. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Alters thought patterns, reducing negative thinking associated with neuroticism.

2. Mindfulness: Reduces anxiety, promotes self-acceptance.

3. Physical Activity: Reduces stress, promotes mood stability.

4. Develop Coping Skills: Strategies to manage stress help mitigate neurotic reactions.


## Increase Your "Locus of Control"

1. Problem-Solving: Identify challenges, generate solutions, take action, reflect on the outcome.

2. Affirmations: Positive self-statements that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors.

3. Goal Setting: Long-term vision with short-term actionable steps promotes a sense of control.

4. Mindfulness: Practice staying present-focused rather than worrying about uncontrollable future events.


## Improving happiness set point involves psychological interventions

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): It focuses on changing thought patterns. Negative thoughts can drag down your happiness set point.

2. Mindfulness Meditation: Regular practice can increase baseline happiness, as it helps reduce stress and promote relaxation.

3. Regular Exercise: It can release chemicals called endorphins which can make you feel happier.

4. Maintain Social Connections: Strong, positive relationships are essential for happiness.

5. Practice Gratitude: Reflecting on positive experiences can boost happiness levels.

Rubric: Evidence based (1-3 points), applicability (1-3 points), detail level (1-3 points).

Confidence:

- CBT: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (2/3), Detail (2/3)
- Mindfulness: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (3/3), Detail (2/3)
- Exercise: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (3/3), Detail (2/3)
- Social Connections: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (3/3), Detail (2/3)
- Gratitude: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (2/3), Detail (2/3)

Overall, I am fairly confident in these recommendations based on scientific literature. However, individual experiences can vary.


## Detailed Activities

### Solo CBT

robbintt@gpt-4 12> Is CBT a solo activity

CBT, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is traditionally a form of psychotherapy conducted with a licensed therapist. In this setting, it is not a solo activity, as you work together with the therapist to identify and address negative thought patterns and cognitive distortions.

However, there are also self-help resources and books available that teach CBT techniques that can be practiced individually. In this case, CBT can be considered a solo activity. Keep in mind that practicing CBT on your own may not be as effective as working with a trained professional, especially when addressing more severe mental health concerns.

In summary, CBT can be both a solo activity (using self-help resources) and a collaborative activity (working with a therapist). The choice depends on individual needs, preferences, and the severity of the issues being addressed.

robbintt@gpt-4 13> What is the research around solo cbt

Research on self-guided or solo Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown promising results. Several studies have found that self-help CBT interventions can be effective for treating various mental health conditions, particularly mild to moderate anxiety and depression.

A meta-analysis of 40 studies on self-help CBT interventions (Andersson & Cuijpers, 2009) showed that these interventions had a moderate effect size in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Another meta-analysis of 15 studies (Cuijpers et al., 2009) examining self-help interventions for depression found a moderate effect size as well.

It is important to note, however, that self-guided CBT may not be as effective as therapist-guided CBT for more severe mental health issues or complex cases. Additionally, self-help interventions may not provide the same level of support, personalization, and feedback as working with a trained professional.

Despite these limitations, self-guided CBT can be a useful option for individuals who may not have access to a therapist, cannot afford therapy, or prefer to work independently. It can be an accessible starting point for those seeking to improve their mental well-being.

1. Understand the basics of CBT: Familiarize yourself with the principles of CBT, which aims to identify and change negative thought patterns and cognitive distortions that contribute to emotional distress.

2. Learn CBT techniques: Study various CBT techniques, such as thought records, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral activation. You can find these techniques in self-help books, online resources, or mobile apps designed for CBT practice.

3. Identify your negative thoughts and cognitive distortions: Start by observing your thoughts, especially when you experience strong emotions. Recognize common cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking, magnification, and personalization.

4. Keep a thought journal: Record your thoughts, emotions, and situations that trigger negative thinking patterns. Note any cognitive distortions and their intensity.

5. Challenge negative thoughts: Question the accuracy and validity of your negative thoughts. Analyze the evidence supporting and contradicting these thoughts and consider alternative explanations.

6. Cognitive restructuring: Replace negative thoughts with more balanced and rational alternatives. Practice this by reframing your thoughts to be more objective and less emotionally charged.

7. Set behavioral goals: Identify and set small, achievable goals that promote positive behaviors and experiences. These goals could include engaging in enjoyable activities, overcoming procrastination, or improving social connections.

8. Monitor your progress: Regularly review your thought journal and progress towards your behavioral goals. Make adjustments as needed and celebrate your successes.

9. Practice mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness meditation or other mindfulness techniques into your daily routine to enhance self-awareness and emotional regulation.
