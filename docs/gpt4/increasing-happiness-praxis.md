# Praxis: Increasing Happiness

From wikipedia: [Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.

> Headey (2008) concluded that an internal locus of control (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) and having "positive" personality traits (notably low neuroticism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being.

> Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being.

> Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's disposable income (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction.

## Daily Happiness Checklist

1. Physical Activity (30 minutes)
   - Engage in your preferred form of exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, yoga, or swimming) to boost mood and reduce stress.

2. Morning Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes)
   - Find a quiet space and spend time focusing on your breath or a mantra to start your day with a calm mind.

3. Social Connection (variable time)
   - Reach out to friends or family members through a phone call, text, or in-person visit to maintain and strengthen relationships.

4. Problem-Solving Practice (10-15 minutes)
   - Identify a challenge you are currently facing, brainstorm possible solutions, and take a small step toward resolving the issue.

5. Goal Review and Progress (5-10 minutes)
   - Reflect on your long-term goals, review the short-term actionable steps you've outlined, and track your progress.

6. Positive Affirmations (5 minutes)
   - Recite affirmations that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors, promoting self-confidence and an internal locus of control.

7. Gratitude Journaling (10 minutes)
   - Write down three things you are grateful for each day to cultivate a positive mindset and increase happiness.

8. Evening Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes)
   - Wind down with another session of mindfulness meditation, focusing on releasing any stress or tension from the day.

Please note that the effectiveness of each activity may vary depending on individual preferences and experiences. The order provided above is based on general effectiveness, but you should adjust the checklist according to your personal needs and priorities.


## Reducing your "Neuroticism"

To reduce neuroticism:

1. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Alters thought patterns, reducing negative thinking associated with neuroticism.

2. Mindfulness: Reduces anxiety, promotes self-acceptance.

3. Physical Activity: Reduces stress, promotes mood stability.

4. Develop Coping Skills: Strategies to manage stress help mitigate neurotic reactions.


## Increase Your "Locus of Control"

1. Problem-Solving: Identify challenges, generate solutions, take action, reflect on the outcome.

2. Affirmations: Positive self-statements that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors.

3. Goal Setting: Long-term vision with short-term actionable steps promotes a sense of control.

4. Mindfulness: Practice staying present-focused rather than worrying about uncontrollable future events.


## Improving happiness set point involves psychological interventions

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): It focuses on changing thought patterns. Negative thoughts can drag down your happiness set point.

2. Mindfulness Meditation: Regular practice can increase baseline happiness, as it helps reduce stress and promote relaxation.

3. Regular Exercise: It can release chemicals called endorphins which can make you feel happier.

4. Maintain Social Connections: Strong, positive relationships are essential for happiness.

5. Practice Gratitude: Reflecting on positive experiences can boost happiness levels.
