The project has an active community, with contributors continuing to work on new features, bug fixes, and improvements.

Minetest has an official forum where users and contributors can discuss the game, development, mods, and other related topics. The project's GitHub repository has over 3,000 stars, and the development team is responsive to issues and pull requests.

Overall, Minetest is in a healthy state, with ongoing development and an engaged community. If you are interested in contributing to a sandbox/voxel game, Minetest is a good choice.

(0.7/8192/5159)
robbintt@gpt-4 47> is it all c++

Minetest's core game engine is primarily written in C++. This includes the rendering engine, networking, and various game systems. However, it also uses the Lua programming language for modding and scripting, allowing users to create custom game modes, items, and functionality using Lua scripts.

If you are looking to contribute to the core engine or game systems, your C++ skills will be applicable. If you are interested in creating mods or extending the game's functionality, you will need to work with Lua scripts.
