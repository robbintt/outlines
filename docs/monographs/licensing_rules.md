### Basic Licensing Rules

1. Does it compile? **Rationale:** if it is interpreted, the source is required to run the application.
    - This criterion should be revisited with a focusing question that focuses more on source distribution rather than the more pedantic 'compiled v interpreted' concept. Specific test cases include uglified or beautified javascript, or pyc/pyo bytecode where the work is altered but there is not a sufficient legal test framework.
    1. `GPL 3` - If it compiles
        - Require descendant projects to use 
    2. `MIT` - If it is interpreted
        - Give more permissiveness
   

2. What about business works?
    - `Apache License` - Is there a case for retaining a separate agreement for business use?
