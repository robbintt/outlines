Trent's untested arena ideas:
=============================
1. Time Matters - Play online at 1-4 PM pacific time to fight weaker opponents. Simply put, children are less capable.
2. Do not play after 11 PM pacific time. Tests in ranked shows that the level of difficulty goes way up due to hardcore players.
3. Be prepared to pick from your top 7 classes. Only 2 may be wholesale ignored. Have your prioritization written down.
4. Removal/Tempo is critical, including board wipe.
5. Weapons = Tempo. They are always picked first.

Always take (incomplete):
=====
all -> chillwind yeti
mage -> enrage cards
priest -> high health
druid -> taunt
midrange -> card draw, 2-for-1, other card advantage.
minions are efficient if they cost half of their combined attack + health. Chillwind Yeti (5/4) = 9, 9/2 = 4.5, 4.5 > 4. Very efficient.
Booty bay bodyguard is bad, it is 5/4 for 5, (4.5 < 5), specifically, a 4 health minion will trade down with a 3-4 cost card.


Going Infinite and Games Per Day
================================
A NOTE: In a sense, with a daily quest and one arena round per day, going infinite actually happens at 6 wins. This nets 106 gold per day average. Coupled with 10 gold for winning 3 rounds you can play arena daily.

Going infinite takes at least 7 wins (on average).
This is a game 7 win ratio higher than 2.25.

You get your gold back after 7 games plus prizes.
The prizes must be worth seven games worth of playing.

GAME 6 WIN RATIO: 3.0 -- (6 wins / 2 losses, then a win after).
The plus is to indicate that the third loss must occur last, so the win rate is actually much higher at different points.  
To accomplish this win rate, you will need an extremely high win rate (lets assume 100%) in the first three rounds, which can taper in the 2nd 3 rounds to 1.33

Notes:
The true breakeven on buying packs is 3-4 games. Over 4 wins is coming out ahead.
It takes up to 4 quests (4 days) to get one arena play, so save your gold!
What is the average gold you get for 3-4 wins?

From the internet (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/11224842495)
0 win = 0-30 gold, average 14 gold
1 win = 0-40 gold, average 17 gold
2 win = 0-50 gold?, average 23 gold
3 win = 30- at least 50 gold, average 41
4 win = 45-85 gold, average 65
5 win = 55-120 gold, average 81
6 win = 75-145 gold, average 106
================================
7 wins = 150-180, average 165
8 wins = 150-220, average 185
9 wins = 150-255, average 211
10 wins = 150-370, average 261
11 wins= 225-510, average 306
12 wins= 225-535, average 332

What about your bankroll?
=========================
You can't win every time. How much do you need to have socked away to keep things smoothly running?
Simple concept: 3 bad beats (0-2 wins) requires 600 gold, including the 4th buy in.


Nick's Arena Tips:
==================
Use Tier Lists (online) - HearthArena, Trump Arena Tier List
Get a good batch of two drops.
Pay attention to your curve.
Many people right now (before the expansion) are really good, so the arena is harder.
It is harder at the end of a season (month of ranked play)
It is harder on the final days of an expansion (less hot, less casual).
Some classes are better than others - see the tier lists. Mages have common removal. Paladins are also very good.

Warming Up:
===========

Presumably there is some limit to how many games per day are fun.
Quest rewards 40 gold and typically take 2-3 games per quest.
One quest is given per day.
This means there are 2-3 games 'guaranteed gold' per day.
Quests can be used as daily warm ups to keep sharp.

It makes sense to do a quest to warm up, then try to go infinite in the arena. You can always pause your arena so if you get bored it won't be an obligation.

Another option is to warm up in the Tavern Brawl.


Training for the Arena:
=======================
1. Get all basic spells for all classes.
2. Play 6-8 tavern brawls for each class to get exposed to new cards you may not have used.
3. USE INFORMATION ONLINE. This should be organized by class so I can quick reference the specific class I end up with.
4. WARM UP BEFORE GOING IN!!
5. You must be prepared to pick 7 of the 9 classes, you may get your worst three picks and have to choose from those.
6. MAYBE: BUILD ALL ARCHETYPES FOR ALL CLASSES??? This takes a lot of common cards, and it can probably be replaced by using information online. However, there are a lot of cards.
