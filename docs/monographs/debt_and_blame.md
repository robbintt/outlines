Blame is like debt. If joe owes bob $2 and bob owes sam $2, that's $4 of debt but only $2 in total transaction. We parked in a spot for breakfast this morning and the car to the left was outside the parking line. So we parked to the right. A second person parked us in to our right, so we had to pull out to enter the vehicle, which is annoying. We blamed them and they blamed us, and we blamed the person to the left. That's about 2 units of blame for one unit of bad behavior, which is analogous to the debt scenario above. Debt and blame can be expanded to fill any connected graph size, such as a whole community, both for blame and debt.
