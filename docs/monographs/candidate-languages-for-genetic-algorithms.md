# Self Description and Self replication and Genetic Algorithms



Candidate Languages for Genetic Algorithms:

1. Binary Lambda Calculus (BLC)
1. Game of Life / Wiring / other derivatives
1. brainfuck
1. m4


### Generating Brainfuck using a genetic algorithm

Project [here](http://lapinozz.github.io/project/2016/03/27/generating-brainfuck-code-using-genetic-algorithm.html).




### Binary Lambda Calculus 

A lot of interesting blc information is stored here: https://tromp.github.io/cl/Binary_lambda_calculus.html

A ton of info from the creator of `tromp`: https://tromp.github.io/cl/cl.html

This ties in closely to computer science theory and brainfuck in general.

The author claims that `tromp` is the most concise possible `universal machine`

### m4 macro language

Written by: Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie

> m4 is a general-purpose macro processor included in all UNIX-like operating systems, and is a component of the POSIX standard.

Someone who made obfuscated casino software (about 20 years before 2018) in brainfuck on hacker news said that they "leaned heavily on make and m4" in order to write most of the brainfuck.
