General notes:

When printing a circle, the back and front (oriented in printer) of each item seemed to have deformation. This is likely a resolution issue or a problem with the model. I saw a much smaller circular print at the same time without that deformity visible, although it may have been available to be seen on the bottom of the item. it was a lot taller (a 1 inch tall, half inch diameter cylinder with a hole in the middle)


PLA

Platform temperature: 70 C recommended

First PLA Print (8 PM)
- Came out great!
- 80 mm/s feedrate
- 100 mm/s travel feedrate
- 190 C nozzle temperature
- 70 C platform temperature
- Painter's tape on platform (fresh)
- Used a raft
- No real deformation

Today's Notes (11.17.15, 4 attempts)
I started  printing at 
Finished printing at around 730 PM.
During this time it got dark and colder as well. Probably started at 72 C ambient room temperature and went to 67 C ambient room temperature.
Alex reported that he could see his breath at NB last night and his print was very deformed. There may have been a relationship.


First Attempt (worked well!)
============================
Extruder @ 220 C
Feedrate 40 mm/s
Travel Feedrate 55 mm/s
Blue painter's tape on platform. Platforma at 110 C.


Second Attempt (Worked very well! I deformed it when prying up.)
=======================
Extruder @ 220 C
This was the nicest sample.
No raft - the coin bent because the platform was not allowed to cool.
Previously, rafts must have allowed the structure of the item to cool faster than the platform, preventing deformation. IMPORTANT IF NOT USING A RAFT!!
Kapton tape on platform. Platform at 130 C.


Third attempt (not good, many deformities)
==========================================
Extruder @ 220 C
Feedrate 80 mm/s was TERRIBLE quality print.
Travel feedrate probably doesn't matter, since it doesn't affect the print?
Travel Feedrate was 80.
Kapton tape on platform. Platform at 130 C.


Fourth attempt (ok, but some deformities):
==========================================
Extruder @ 220 C
Feedrate 40 mm/s was much nicer than the recommended 80 mm/s
Travel feedrate probably doesn't matter, since it doesn't affect the print?
Travel Feedrate was 40.
Kapton tape on platform. Platform at 135 C.

print temperature 220-230 C for small to large (higher for larger)
