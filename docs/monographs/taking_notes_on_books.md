### Goals

Read comprehensively the first time and ensure that key information is ingested.


### My Method

1. As you read, take notes in an outline. Allow the outline to take its own form. Use supporting information.
    - Short Summaries
    - Key Quotes
    - Page Numbers
    - References
2. Transcribe the outline into a markdown file. Enhance the supporting information and create a references section.
