# Deciding on the Next Book

I have trouble with books in my queue. I want to read them, but I always pick up something totally off my queue when it's time.


## Process Goal

- Avoid recency bias when selecting what book to read next
- Have a quick process to pick the next book from an existing queue.
- Have a digital queue to pick from
- Trim my bookshelves and avoid buying books before they are selected.


### Interest Inquiry

Develop a short series of questions I can use to decide what kind of book I want next.


### Content Inquiry

Develop a short series of questions I can ask chatgpt about a specific book to supplement the interest inquiry, since it can discover information about the works in question quickly and relatively accurately, including some judgment calls.




## Reading Goals

quick draft


### Some Specific Works or "sets"

1. all historic scifi award winning novels and keep up each year
  - also historic short stories, a bit harder to locate, but much lower commitment
2. some classic american literature, both novel and short story
3. classic story collections:
  - grimm's fairy tales
  - burton's collection/translation: "A thousand nights and one night" (known casually as Arabian Nights or 1001 nights)
  - art of war
  - tale of genji
  - romance of the three kingdoms (4 volume translation from my childhood?)
