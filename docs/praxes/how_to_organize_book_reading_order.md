# Deciding on the Next Book

I have trouble with books in my queue. I want to read them, but I always pick up something totally off my queue when it's time.


## Main Question / Premise

"Why would I prioritize a new book when I have a queue of high quality books already ordered?"

## Two main topics

1. How to survey a nonfiction book to decide whether and when to read it?
2. How to select the next fiction book to read based on the book's properties and your current goals?


## Process Goal

- Avoid recency bias when selecting what book to read next
- Have a quick process to pick the next book from an existing queue.
- Have a digital queue to pick from
- Trim my bookshelves and avoid buying books before they are selected.


### Interest Inquiry

Develop a short series of questions I can use to decide what kind of book I want next.


### Content Inquiry

Develop a short series of questions I can ask chatgpt about a specific book to supplement the interest inquiry, since it can discover information about the works in question quickly and relatively accurately, including some judgment calls.



## Fiction Books

- classic fiction
- pop fiction works
- award winning fiction
- reading deeper with a beloved author
- uncertain quality fiction


## Nonfiction Books

- topical overview
  - popular nonfiction
- topical survey (some depth)
  - textbooks (topical survey?)
- technical reading
  - where is the boundary of training material?
  - when is reading not learning/training material?
- self improvement


## When to read the audiobook?

- Peculiarly, some fiction books are terrible as audiobooks
  - Would "American Gods" be better on paper? How about the 4 hyperion cantos books?
- Topical overviews & popular nonfiction
  - Often better to skip the book / replace with wikipedia
  - **might be better to do nothing and reflect/recall your other working topics instead.**
  - "Is it bringing you joy?"


## Reading Goals


### Some Specific Works or "sets"

1. all historic scifi award winning novels and keep up each year
  - also historic short stories, a bit harder to locate, but much lower commitment
2. some classic american literature, both novel and short story
3. classic story collections:
  - grimm's fairy tales
  - burton's collection/translation: "A thousand nights and one night" (known casually as Arabian Nights or 1001 nights)
  - art of war
  - tale of genji
  - romance of the three kingdoms (4 volume translation from my childhood?)
