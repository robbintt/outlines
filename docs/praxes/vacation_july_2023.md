# Vacation 2023

Some time to focus on my way of being.

## Look back at 2023 New Year Goals

My Analysis: "it seems like i can just read scifi, workout, and program c++ for the rest of the year, and work on my creativity process which is my top one right now."

### Lose 8 lbs

- need to start doing this, i know exactly what to do. 
- i can be done by october if I start by the end of vacation.
- tentative start date: 2023-7-27
- goals: don't eat any burgers/fries, indian, pizza
  - 1 cheat meal per week, historically do it on a wednesday
  - probably want to leave it up to me to decide when


### Keep participating actively and doing recall on my personal training

- TODO - add my new personal fitness goals to my 2023 goals
    - mobility - shoulders, hips, ??
    - compound weightlifting practice (squats, deadlifts, etc)
    - "at home" practice
    - better fitness "goalsetting"
    - what else?


### Work on my creative process

- TODO - eed to review my summaries for the Michalko books, and keep reading.
- TODO - Write a "creative process" markdown / outline / cliff notes for reviewing
- TODO - review the learning how to learn stuff in the context of creativity
- ONGOING - Find creative applications in my every day life

### Write c++

I'm not really listless here so much as "uncollected"

- TODO: get collected in my c++ learning
- TODO - review the learning how to learn stuff in the context of c++
- TODO: consider if I should learn java this year based on my H2 goals.


### Read scifi

Goal: none yet, keep reading what I am reading in the gym

Can I add a paper book? Do I have too much reading going on already?

I have had a lot of boring scifi misses or light scifi. I am missing the "ringworld" style mindbenders that dream up whole new possibiltiies.


## I would like to:

- maintain a clear mind
    - keep space in every thought and decision for innovation or creativity
- maintain my practices for: diet, fitness, and meditation
- focus on big lifts
- not get caught in the weeds of a particular lift


## Non Goals


- No "catching up"
    - small projects fit in my regular life
    - don't waste big blocks of time on small projects
    - resist "catching up", it doesn't exist
- No "catching up" with books
    - this is part of the regular practice
    - if there is a book, it should be related to my "vacation projects"
- No discord / slack / hacker news / reddit
    - don't read the news, just take the time off
    - don't get on weird tangents
- No code for the sake of code
    - I get enough of this
    - this fits in the "small projects" that fit in my regular life
- No Dragonrealms
    - Spent enough time here, this is just for tinkering
    - This is tiny projects not worth a big block of time
- No Home Network & Home Automation
    - This isn't important
    - This is fun to tinker with, but it's a good side project for smaller blocks of time
- No Financial Planning
    - I have a full 10-11 year financial plan and it is on track
    - Any investment in this is overinvestment
- No Apartment/Housing Pain Points
    - Discussing any housing situation changes
    - Materially improving our current apartment
- No Professional Development
    - I can work on this after vacation
    - I just finished a major milestone and have room to breathe
    - this is doing fine




## Goals

- set SMART goals for my goals/visions
    - For broad goals/visions, set a few more specific SMART goals
- have an optimized diet and improve my practice
- impove my meditation practice
- break the habit mold of my exercise repeatibly
  - leverage learning, pratice, and trainer

## Vacation Projects

Question: how will I balance deep dives / "big blocks" with "new discovery"

Things I am interested in:
1. woodworking
2. c++
3. cross compiling c++
  - for esp32
  - for openwrt
4. embedded controllers
5. leveraging llms
  - don't want to rabbit hole
  - i will have this at work when I get back, for free
6. self documentation
  - i have been doing this on the weekends
  - might be worth a big block to:
    1. enumerate this stuff
    2. write a basic gpt4 assisted doc for each
7. inventors and creativity




## Documentation

### List of things I would like to document

- diet: just start with current practice, let it flow
    - not a huge priority, but want to get the draft down
- meditation: current practice
- learning: learning how to learn / habit forming + chunking + ?
- exercise: practice, current, and some alternatives and swapping in
    - this is intended to be documented once then improved immediately and radically

## Woodworking

- Idea: focus on copying others' designs to offload goal setting workload
- Goal: Less planning, more small scale executive, more with the hands


## Personal Maintenance

Vision: Document what I am doing in terms of maintenance so I can improve over time in a directed way.

Overarching goal: Use my markdown outlines and openai to standardize my important personal management practices.


### Daily Skill Building

- Spend some time every day writing down all my practices
- spend some time with the creativity books every day



### Meditation

- write down some core of my practice into markdown
- consistent daily practice
- improve daily mindfulness and awareness
- find some new meditations to listen to
- do some directed research


### Exercise

- everything i learn will be well documented to carry forwards
- break out of my typical exercise routine
- extra time in the gym
- research adian's ideas and expand on them
- decouple some exercise routine from the gym, using substitution and alternative goals

### Diet

- done eating by 5 PM
- eat from the refrigerator
- solid well planned daily diet
- no special foods, really eat regularly and healthily
- no upset stomach
