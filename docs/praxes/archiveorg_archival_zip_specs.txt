To upload a zip to archive.org
==============================
crop images to be consistent (as they should look in the book)
image filenames must be in order (from beginning to end)
rename into a zip file, eg: foo_images.zip (must end in `_images.zip`)  Foo MAY need to be an indentifier, not sure. Maybe it could be anything.
To test:
========
Go to archive.org, choose upload a file, update.
(worked)


Spreads:
========
Try spreads for cropping, white balance, etc.
spreads - modular workflow assistant - https://github.com/DIYBookScanner/spreads


after uploading:
================
you can check at the unique identifier of your item uploaded
after 2 hours, maybe ask gio to check what's going on
anyone who creates an archive.org account can upload a book


If I start uploading a lot of books:
====================================
archive.org can give me a collection which is a folder with all my contents
This would be for multiple people to share in an org, so we could have a noisebridge-digital-archivists collection
Gio can do this for me in about 5 minutes when I am ready. They don't give the feature out to the public quite yet.
Only users with at least 150, but for Noisebridge they can just do it.
We could definitely use this for the Noisebridge datastore.

We could also share a user - noisebridge-books-bot for example.


timeline:
=========
200 book page takes hours - there are often 1200 books in the pipeline
if something never comes out, gio can give me feedback
if something is broken, gio can give feedback



white balance:
===============
archive uses a color card in the photo and a robot balances this to white in software
