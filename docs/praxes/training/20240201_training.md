# 2024.2.1 Training Notes


1. Hit the upper back and neck safely
    - iso-lateral low row - keep a straight back without arching, get the elbows back
    - ? machine
        - exercise 1: rip it open, again keep a straight back without arching
        - exercise 2, opposite side:
            - shrugs standard,
            - shrugs shoulder forwards,
            - then shrug and rotate forwards, then shrug and rotate backwards
        - 45 degree bench, prone, 7.5 lb dumbbells
            - raise your hands in an H with thumbs up
            - also do the same with thumbs fully rotated in, it is also mobility
            - keep a straight back, you should not be arching your back
            - these will target posterior delt and other stuff
            - different than my other exercises
2. Band exercises for legs - Things I can do at home with a baby
    - big overlap with covid, can do some remote sessions if needed
    - need bands
    - Blue Slingshot leg band
        - go all the way to squat position, let one knee in, then force it all the way back out and hold, repeat
            - 10 times on each side
            - 10 times with both at the same time
        - legs wide in full squat
            - 15 squats pushing the bands out each time (this is hard, i did 3x6 with 30 second short breaks)
        - lay down on side, clamshell
            - keep the foot directly on top of the other when you clamshell
            - keep the but in line with the feet, it is difficult to get a feel for setting it up
            - 10 reps on each side
        - glute bridge, 3 phases
            - lay on back, 1. contract abs, push up with the hips, do not arch back 2. squeeze the glutes without relaxing the hips 3. push against the bands with your knees at the top
            - have a straight line from knees to shoulders at the top
