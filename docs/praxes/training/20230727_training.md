# Training Today


## Exercises

1. Dynamic Warmup - Lunges with Arms in stirrups
    - lunge forwards and feel the arms pull out
    - use the T and the Y shapes to stretch the arms and shoulders
    - do this for a few minutes
2. Barbell Rack Squats
    - weights: bar, 25s, 35s, 45s
    - I only got like 4 of the barbell+45s, but will be able to do more later
    - SAFETY: when racking, walk bar into the rack all the way, then lower
    - SAFETY: when racking, don't jam your finger
    - pull the bar down onto the traps and engage the lats, keep it locked
    - hands are of a natural distance on the grip, outside the shoulders
    - keep using the broom handle daily to improve the shoulder mobility
    - take one step back from the rack only
    - ensure feet are aligned on a line on the floor
    - get some flat shoes
    - time to squat. Breathe in all the way before lowering
    - activate your abs and core, keep your lats activated, and lower
    - the bar should go STRIGHT DOWN AND UP
    - your butt should not go out a lot
    - your knees should not go forwards, only very slightly at the bottom and stay over your toes, not pass the toes
4. RDL deadlifts?
    - weights: barbell + 25 each
    - I think that means romanian deadlift
    - keep the bar pushing against your legs the whole time
    - keep the lats activated
    - remember feeling with trainer pulling bar away from my legs with a band
    - go from upright to a few inches below the knee
    - hands must be symmetrical on the bar
    - AVOID INJURY: activate the abs and core, otherwise you will activate the back too much
3. balance, step backwards into foot saddle, lunge knee to ground
    - sqeeze the back foot's glute as you get into the position
    - feel the front quad burn, feel the back hip stretch
    - go to the bottom to get your spacing when needed
    - should be a lunge position with front knee over foot
4. Captain's chair:
    a. 15 both leg raises, don't lower too far, lower abs
    b. 10 (20 total) - one leg raises alternating
    c. purpose: improve core to support squats

## Planning for this week

- I would like to focus on technique with barbell rack squats
  - my feeling is I could do 4x12 every other day focusing solely on technique in addition to my normal workouts (maybe not leg day)
- It's important to hit the captain's chair hard to build core stability
- also do everything else
