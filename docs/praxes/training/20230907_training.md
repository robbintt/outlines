# Training Session


## Deadlifts with Viper Grips

- Was able to do bar+25s easily, with good form
- Keel the shoulders down and back, pinch a pencil between your shoulderblades
- Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way up, each of 10 reps
- Was able to do bar+35s pretty easily as well
- Feel confident this weight will go up as I keep practicing
- The gloves should put a lot of the weight onto the wrists
    - be sure to keep the bar tight against the hand and avoid holding it too tight with pinkies
    - the pain I had without was in the left ulnar side (electric shock from pinkie to outside of wrist)


## Farmer's Walk

- Did 60s in each hand, used the viper hand grips for this as well.
- Smaller steps are better!
- Lower the weights by squatting down with a straight back
- Walk about 10 meters, turn to the left or right (alternate) and walk back.
- Keep your chest up and powerful (confident chest)
- Each step should be well controlled
- When I was getting tired I really started to feel the same engagement as a squat
    - what I mean is squeezing the knees out and feeling the outsides of the hips engaged
- I really like this one, but I don't know exactly where the engagement should come from yet
    - spend more time on this next week
- Hand position is at rest at the sides
- Avoid - Alternate hand position is hands in front of shoulders at a 45 degree angle to the head, weight nearly over shoulders - max weight for this position was only 35-40 lbs, not sure)
    - Avoid this due to pressure on the wrists

## Mobility

- Plank with arms, keep the chest over the hands for a good plankl
    - Weight should NOT be in the legs.
    - To keep yourself honest, plank in socks on a slippery floor. No friction on feet bc no feet support should be used.
