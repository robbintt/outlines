# Core Day

- ab machine, lots of foot position work.
    - keep your head back
    - use your hands to pull forwards as needed, but use your abs to go back (eccentric)
    - don't relax at the bottom, keep the abs engaged
    - a lot of upper abls
    - feet positions: feet on the guards, feet up in the air, feet low around the base (inside midsole), on hip twisted with feet crossed and foot over taking the tension, and one more

- Foot sliders:
    - plank position
        - hardest: elbow plank feet together and slide forward then back subtly to activate abs, dragging feet
        - each leg extended out to right, don't go so far that you move your ankle
            - both legs after each
        - each leg knee bend slide foot up to hip outward arc, felt in hip flexor
        - downward dog style plank, goal is to go fully bent at the hip, then go back to plank slowly, but you need downward dog good for this. heels up though which is easier

- plank progression: to extend the regular plank walk the hands forwards. eventually you need to put some wt on feet with this progression

- kettle bell in one hand, stand straight shoulders back, and slide other hand down hip. at halfway point you swap ab sides to the other side, from a pulling to a opposite side pushing
- kettle bell "opposite plank, which is like on your butt, lower, and mid back, feet up, and kettle bell in your arms in front of you, with no kettle bell you put your arms back and overhead

- using the black plastic foam roller with hand holds, sit on your butt, legs up, then punch the right side of it out over the left side, retract and repeat opposite.

- captain chair, knees up to chest, also legs straight out

- old school roman chair, same glute ham exercise with the fixed wt 2 hand barbell
    - roll the shoulders forwards, manually engage the glutes, should feel the hamstrings too
