# Training 2024.2.27


Notes:
- Squats still have a tiny buttwink, but look great with a 40 lb kettlebell
- Remaining buttwink may be reduced further by focusing on hamstrings
  - also do the other hamstring exercises, with the ball or slider


Exercises

1. Hamstring focused below-floor straight legged deadlifts
  - lengthen and strenthen hamstrings
  - a stair would work, you can't make it all the way down at first, it will get further over time
  - use a kettlebell, tried 40 lbs, maybe 60? can probably do more
  - focus on consciously activating the hamstrings, manually de-emphasize the glutes, but still protect the back


2. A-frame exercise
  - this is for olympic lift mobility
  - make an L with your feet, the turned foot extends to a good bit over shoulder width
  - lock a kettlebell/dumbbell above your head in the shoulder with a straight elbow
  - with the other arm and torso, run the palm down the leg focusing on approaching the out midfoot
  - you should not be using muscle to support the kettlebell, it should be locked in the shoulder, focused on increasing mobility


3. discussed how to fix imbalance going to the left during my squat
  - verify this: lengthen the left outside and right inside, strengthen the left inside and right outside


4. Behind the neck snatch press
  - attempted with PVC pipe, then 10 kg bar, then 20 kg bar - all good, be careful!
  - start with the bar on traps as squat
  - bar always stay vertically aligned with the starting position
  - head forwards, press the bar straight up
  - you should have your back completely locked, holding a pencil back there.
  - lower the bar, near the shoulders, dip your body slightly to match velocity and catch the bar with the legs


5. Behind the neck snatch press and squat
  - attempted with PVC pipe, then 10 kg bar, then 20 kg bar - all good, be careful!
  - squat ass to grass
  - perform the behind the neck snatch press
  - keep your head forwards, almost jammed
  - stand up in the extended snatch press position
  - return the bar as per behind the neck snatch press
