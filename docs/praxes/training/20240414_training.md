Bench press is off center towars right arm, need to look into why. 

Hints:

- may be over strong in right arm due to baby carrying in right arm. Use left arm evenly
- form when holding baby avoid forward shoulder
- could be compensating due to right shoulder pain
- could be middle finger grip on ring guide. Should grip be wider or something? Recommended first finger in the past

Focused on shoulder tricep complex at top of arm

- band exercises:
- 
- pull band from tension at arm front facing followed by extending arm to be parallel with body with straight elbow. Don't let the shoudler rise
- (another one?) TODO
- pull down bands with shoulders tucked back. Can also do just standing there without resistance. Or practice hanging on dip bars as well.
- 
- 
- 5 to 10 lbs weights in arms straight on the knees, thumbs facing up. starting in the upright squat position then move shoulders up into the Y position in terms of AITY with the thumbs always up
- 
- 
- video - stretch the lateral and also the it band against a pole
- 
- 
- push ups sliding 1 arm forward and keeping force with both arms
- also slide arm sideways
- slide arm sort of out in the A direction in terms of AITY

- foam rolling:
- foam roll always at muscle insertion and "output what is the word" where the muscle ends...
- triceps end under and around the armpit area and originate in the elbow area
- there is a deltoid tricep complex overlapping where I am getting new pain (likely from carrying the baby)
