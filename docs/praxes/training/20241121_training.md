## Glutes Focus

1. warm up - stretching with the kettle bell, straight back deadlift but not for weight
    - keep the shoulders locked as deadlift
    - bend at the hips but keep legs straight, get kettle bell to 1 inch above floor
    - 
1. some kind of thigh glide machine
    - did it once, but didn't want to use the knees too much yet
1. glute thrust - belt
    - very important to keep the back not flexed, core straight
    - keep abs flexed core tight, back completely straight
        - i did use a valsava maneuver to practice, but trainer says inhale down exhale on the way up
    - eyes stay locked forward past knees to wall
    - like you are sitting in a chair
1. roman chair - outside glutes
    - this really burns my outside glutes, keep doing it
    - shoulders rounded, use a straight fixed short bar of like 20 lbs
    - back rounded, shoulders stay extended, also elbows. the arms stay relaxed
    - the activation is not in the back
    - pull the bar in with your legs as you come up from relaxed
    - don't use the back
1. clamshells
    - feet higher than you think
    - keep the top foot on a ridge of the bottom foot
    - reach the over arm as far as you can to counteract opening at the top
    - only open at the bottom
    - blue band
    - feel it in the glutes
1. monster walk
    - blue band
    - reach out then back to squat
    - move from the glutes, like you are sitting in a chair
