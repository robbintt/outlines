# Coconut Chicken Curry

From: https://www.theendlessmeal.com/creamy-coconut-chicken-curry/

## Modification Ideas

- I used canned chicken (meh) but would prefer to use sliced chicken breast
- Try replacing the chicken with tofu and vegetable boullion
- Try replacing olive oil with coconut oil. Why?
- Might be able to shorten the cook time before adding the coconut milk


## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 bulb (10-12 cloves) Garlic, minced or crushed
- 2 tbsp ginger, diced
- 28 oz tomatoes, diced - 8x 3.5oz tomatoes 
- 8-16 oz chicken - 1 can chicken


## Curry Mix

Grind the spices together in a coffee grinder.

- 1 tbsp turmeric
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds
- 1 tbsp coriander seed
- 1 tsp fenugreek seed
- 1 tsp fennel


## Additional Spices

I recommended cooking 2 cups basmati rice. I used a ricemaker.

1. Saute the diced onion, garlic, and ginger in 2 tbsp olive oil
