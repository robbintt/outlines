__About Mark:__ Mark is building single page blazing fast apps in react/redux for startups.


### Outline

1. "No Install" apps are desirable
    - Future: People want offline 'native feeling' web apps 

2. NPM is (opinion) where all dependencies should go, no longer bower

3. Companies are managing apps facing all the different facets of their business
    - e.g. facing both customers and sellers

4. Reusability is key... so develop in Components!
    - Publish your React Components on NPM.
    - `npm publish` "and you're done"

5. Case Study: Material-UI - Google Material React Components

6. Case II: Mark's component - `material-ui-youtube-autocomplete`

7. Write good documentation!
    - How to install
    - How to use
    - A great example using github pages
    - A solid github readme

8. Use [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) to create your component
    - "Tooling in a single `devDependency` for developing, testing, building:
        1. React Apps
        2. React Components and Libraries
        3. npm Modules for the Web
    - nwb builds your __demo page__ for you

9. Nota Bene: You can deliver js and css together through npm in separate files
