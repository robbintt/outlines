# Lacrosse Ball Myofascial Release

Speaker: ?
Date: 2019-09-10

- typically 40-60 seconds for any body part
- 2 rounds if you have time
- quads, hamstrings, glutes, back, everything
- the second round you really rolling pin it around
- do this type of stuff before a workout to open up your fascia and allow muscles to work through greater range of motion and minimize injury
- relax as much as you can, if you tighten it up the ball is tougher to get in there
- do every single part of the muscle
- this is different than stretching, surrounding every muscle is fascia, also attaches muscle to skin and other muscles
- ball breaks things up in there, if you are cringing a lot drink a lot of water - "releasing a bunch of toxins and broken up stagnant toxins into your bloodstream"
- never have any alcohol before/after a massage
- we tend to do the same movements over and over, sitting, walking, whatever... lots of stagnant tissue
- use straight up PVC pipe as a foam roller. Foam rollers get soft over time and won't work
- try not to use the muscles you are releasing to apply force
- what's the best exercise? foam rolling, decreases sore timing, keeps you from getting injured
- whenever i fly i bring a lacrosse ball and do it in the airport

## Sit on the ball on the ground - butt muscles

- get as close to the bone without being on the bone, that will hurt
- hip is a ball and socket joint, sit on the ball and trace the socket

## Sit on the ball on the chair

- put under hamstring

## against the wall - spine-shoulderblade, lats

- do sort of a wall sit
- put ball between shoulderblade and spine against the wall, lean into it
- explore around your back
- lats tend to get really tight, definitely try these

## extensors

- trace from your elbow out to your wrist
- outside of arm against wall while standing
- use inside of arm on the table, push it down with other arm

## Feet

- stand and apply force against bottom of foot... i guess just try everywhere... from right in front of your heel
- pull your toes back and roll forward on the foot towards the toes
- "reconnect the neuromuscular connections"
- do you notice crunchies in your feet? "fascia starts to calcify... on a cellular level" - lol wtf sure why not

## Calf

- ball on the floor, calf on the ball
- most people don't realize how tight they are until they do it
- pick your hips up a bit to float over, good to use a block to raise the hips on this one
- relax your ankle as you roll into it, don't flex it

# Foam Rollers Abbreviated Version

- For IT band definitely use this instead of the ball
- "t something" like a rolling pin, about 2 inches diameter, good for calves and easier to get in there
- some tool i missed for something something
- try softball instead of lacrosse ball, it's bigger, maybe a bit more manageable - good for hips, calves
- i don't really like the knobs on the foam roller (trent: i think tons of knobs like a texture). idea is that they're for pressure points, but it is hard to pinpoint pressure points. consistently firm foam roller is better

## Scalenes are some of the tightest muscles

- do it yourself with your fingers, push down and do normal 40-60 sec, 2 sessions
- i find right on the inside of my collarbone, then tilt my head back
- so pin it then stretch back (tilt head back)
- might feel ticklish, neck, nausea, address it carefully
- scalenes go in a lot of different directions, so feel those out
- text neck is horrible (looking down)

## Cheek muscles, also use your fingers

- relax your face before you start
