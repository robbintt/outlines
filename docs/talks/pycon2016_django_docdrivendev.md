Using the django project as an example for great ddd.

What's so good?

* clear and consistent within structure
* covers just about everything
* held to a high standard
* ?
* regarded as a process rather than a product


Results:
* Django is easier to adopt
* Makes people better django programmers
* lowers support burden
* makes people faster

Software is not the only thing that develops, grows, improves.

Communities of programmers also develops, grows, improves.


#### What does documentation mean for the development of communities and products?


#### Writer keeps riffing on the same stuff. His words have depth but not immediately actionable.
