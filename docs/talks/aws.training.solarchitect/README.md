# AWS Solutions Architect Daylong Training

Purpose: Prep for AWS Solutions Architect exam.

Can you take cloud practitioner exam online?


## acloud.guru videos

These videos were specifically called out for their VPC lab: https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate`o

I took an Udemy "Backspace Academy" 10-part VPC lab which I found quite good. I have not done the acloud.guru one to compare.
