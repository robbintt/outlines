# Exam Taking Strategies

Sleep well, eat well, arrive a few minutes early to the testing center.

It's a long exam period (2 hours?), the guy next to me was done in an hour.

Keep track of your time, mark a tough question and go back.

Remember the relative grading.


## Exams are on a curve

- You want to aim for above 70%
- There's no set passing score
- If you get a very low score you could still pass
- You get your score


## Tips

- Read the question carefully
  - Seriously
  - All of it
- Read the answers
- Use process of elimination
- **Refer to other questions**
  - you can go back and forth between questions
- Time management is critical
- When in doubt **GUESS**



## Test Axioms

- "Single AZ": NEVER the right answer
- Using AWS managed services should always be preferred
  - RDS over setting up a database on EC2
- Fault Tolerance is DIFFERENT THAN Fault Tolerance
  - HA == Multiple AZs
  - Fault Tolerant = What happens when everything everywhere goes down


## Sample Exam Question 1

I took a photo of it.

Strategy: Eliminate 2, validate remaining two.

Watch out for where one is "all of the above" lol


## Sample Exam Question 3: SELECT THREE

- Which is NOT right?

## Sample Exam Question 4: SELECT TWO


## Sample Exam Question 5: SELECT TWO

- Eliminate Single AZ
- Since cost is a priority, we use exactly what we need: 4 instances

Probably not on SA exam, probably on developer

Need to know a lot:
  - What are mappings, parameters in cloudformation, are AMI ids different or the same?


## Sample Question 7: Elimination

## Sample Question 8: Need to know RTO and RPO... how can we deduce...

- Specific to Disaster Recovery Plan
