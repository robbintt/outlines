OpenDNS - Why use elastic search? 7-14-15

Wikipedia uses elastic search for their full text search.
Github uses elastic search for structured searches in a repository.

You could build a kayak style search in elastic search if you wanted with a single query.
Kibana allows visualization of data by making heavy use of elastic search.

What is it? Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine, designed for horizontal scalabilty, reliability, and easy management.

Elasticsearch wraps Lucine, a Java? library, and makes it available via a REST API.

Every piece of data by default keeps 2 copies of each datum. Has a REST API.

Elastic Search itself is open source.  Elastic is the company behind elastic search.

CONCEPTS:

Concept: "Document" - The unit of data fed into elasticsearch in JSON format.

{ 
  "from" : "tony@stark.com",
  ...
}

Concept: "Comparing RDBMS <-> ElasticSearch"
mapping:
database->index
table->type
(2 more)
->
field->


Now lets translate SQL to ElasticSearch (see presentation)
Get/Select mapped directly

Update is a little more interesting (just some documents/rows)


WHY??? SEARCH for a SINGLE term in a SINGLE field:
SQL: SELECT * FROM emails WHERE body LIKE "% have %";

We lose 'stemming', we might also want to match 'having' as well as 'have'. ElasticSearch does this internally, apparently.
