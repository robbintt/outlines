# Deep Work Quality Reference Sheet

## Cal Newport's Methods for Rating Deep Work

---

### 1. Deep Work Formula

**High Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) × (Intensity of Focus)**  
- Maximize both the hours and your focus for best results.

---

### 2. The "Recent College Graduate" Test

**Ask:**  
*How many months would it take to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?*

- Many months = Deep Work
- Little/no training = Shallow Work

---

### 3. Qualitative Criteria

Ask yourself:
- Does this task require focused attention?
- Does this task require specialized training or knowledge?
- Does this task create new value in the world?
- Would this task be difficult to replicate?

*If you answer "yes" to most, it's deep work.*

### 4. Deep Work Hours Scoreboard

- Track and display your deep work hours daily.
- Use a visible tally (on paper, whiteboard, or digital tool) to motivate yourself.
