1300 101: Controlling IoT Devices With Crafted Radio Signals

Wirelessly controlled outlet switches
REmoved control unit, soldered in transistors, and could remote control the buttons
Music theory: spectral analysis
Wireless hacking, wireless protocol attack often can't be fixed with a patch
802.11 monitor mode, to figure out if wireless camera can be used for motion detection
We'll explore the physical layer

"Harness the invisible energy all around us!" -Jedi quote.
IoT: all wireless attacks have 5000% damage power now
Many things operate thru radio: Cell, TV, Wifi, BT, GPS, wireless sec sys,
His device: HackRF One: Great Scott Gadgets (SDR)
LimeSDR, RTL-SDR (cheaper)
Wizard metaphor: transmitting power thru your wand (antenna)
Attacked his Jeep Patriot with the HackRF
Gnu Radio on notebook, using it to turn on Jeep
It was a replay attack.  Some cars have rolling codes, which might be defeatable.
Jamming attack: jam_narrow.py 420420000

$ python3 ask_modulate_radio_signal.py -c raw_data/outlet_c2_on.json -o /tmp/radio_signal.pcm
$ ./transmit_signal.py -f /tmp/radio_Signal.pcm

Config file with bit string, frewquency, baud rate, etc.

Shows captured signal on SDR, converted to audio, in Audacity
Audio tools can be reused for radio hacking
ASK on off key
Short bursts are zeros, long burst ones.

Open wave files in Audacity by specifying the base Hz, and it resamples to audible.
Do not need to know the math.  Gnu Radio will handle much of it.

Convoluted waves can be deconvoluted
Many things are waves: breathing, temperature of earth, quantum theory
Derivative of a sine wave is itself, another sine wave
Superposition principle: how can you hear many things at once?
How can there be multiple radio waves in the air at once?

Euler's formula relates e^x to sin(x) and cos(x)
e^ipi =

Radios actually use a circular sine wave, not a flat 2d sine wave

 - Unique names are a pivot: "Kis*" means eastern europe descent
 - Reverse Google search on an avatar to find unique matches
 - Unique name is able to be pivoted from searches
 - Key phrases/questions can be searched / cross refed
 - Phrases with location, date, names can be merged
 - Time frame on posts can be used to create a timeline of movement/thinking for profiling

W3C - Since 2013 they've pursued a course unwise, to make a DRM standard for the web.
This allows DRM vendors to work with browser vendors to seamlessly integrate DRM into browsers.
EFF have joined and failed to convince W3C
"Go ahead if you must make DRM, but don't involve the membership."
Compromise: doesn't stop W3C members from suing anybody.
Says W3C can't use DRM to threaten developers.

### 100 Facebook accounts per day - m0m0 (Deloitte MX City) - into breaking things for fun
FB Issue #331801952
POF, exploiting en masse, we got paid!, remediation, what's next?
- Facebook mobile app implements content thru "instant articles" -2016
- Content from third parties can be viewed, shared, saved etc in FB
- Found a session hijacking vuln in this functionality
- Informed FB in their bug bounty program

How it works
- Detected when sharing links from the FB mobile app
- Lack of proper validation in "one tap login"
- "Links shared with a session_key and api_key
- Allows a third party to steal the session when opening the link in a browser since the browser asks to initiate session as the user uses the link

POF
- A legitimate user opens an instant article on FB mobile app
- User shares it by tapping Share, then Copy link
- User shares the link copied thru any social media
- Exposes the session_key
4. Malic user opens the link and notes that the browser asks to initiate session as the user that initially shared the link!
5. The malicious user accepts and gains the other user's session

Exploiting the vuln en masse
- IT was not easy to test this issue since we identified that the vuln was not always present when sharing a link
- Searching Google for these links, to steal valid sessions from FB accounts

Search twitter for: "m.facebook.com/auth.php" and see += ?api_key=asdfasdf&session_key=asdfasdf

Realtime searches, using "tresor"?
Search vulnerable urls
search twitter for "facebook.com/auth.php"

Commens contain plenty of dirty data
- Code
- Bad chars (punctuation etc)

### 30 July - I can tell what you are by the smell of your wifi

Multiple signatures
Clients behave differently depending on the AP
APs advertise capabilities, clients react accordingly
e.g. 2.4 ghz, 5 ghz, power management capabilities

He caches signatures in the database. Uses three different signatures
Sometimes devices have ambigious signatures
To distinguish, they include the upper 24 bits of MAC address

Only the AP can see the DHCP address/signature unencrypted

Some client devs have same signature, i.e. iPad Air 2nd gen & iphone 6s

They developed a WiFi taxonomy
If we could just know what the chipset of a device is, we'd find clever workarounds based on HW or bugs
List of connected clients display in a UI
Correlated with other data - a useful hostname in the DHCP client req
Packet reordering (for lower latency) is a signature element
WIDS (wireless intrusion detec sys) a factor
Published papers: arxiv.org/abs/1608.01725

Current status of Impl
- hostapd 2.6 added CONFIG_TAXONOMY
- database of known signatures released to github
- 907 signatures of 172 devs
- ~60% of connected devices are known signatures

What's next
- Integration
- Better tools to gather signatures, it's a manually intensive process
  - Handle dependency on AP
- AP taxonomy?



Power Laws
- Natural processes, they're statistical
- Things descriptive of natural processes follow power laws
- When they don't, something's wrong
- Not all nat processes are natural
- Financial transactions e.g.
- You can use power laws to detect fraud

Natural distribution vs power law distrivution

Why matters?
= Somehow network traffic is "natural"
- Good lord the machines are alive!
- So power laws must ally
- Some power laws can be hard coded
- Extremely low cost and fast anomaly detection

(I wonder vs NN)

Benford's Law
- Simple and awesome power law
- If it's a number...
- Generated by a process...
- The more articicial the packet, the worse the anomaly
- Flood DDoS (Amplification, tcp, etc attack) are very loud
- Can be clearly seen in gestalt connection data
- Practically instantaneous
- Realtime in 100Mb/Gigabit scenarious
- No training at all

How it's done
- Get a tcpdump
- Extract features
- Power law analysis tells us goodness
- Prnt out to csv with timestamp
- Or throw an alarm
- Iptables maybe, as a trigger endpoint/handler

What to do with it?
- Watch for DDoS attacks
- Probably won't save your network
- Can determine if someone is using your PC for something nefarious
- DDoS zombie instead of WTF is this?
- Determine between attack types, too

What else can you do: IDS
- DoS isn't the only kind of disturbance
- Obviously we don't know what all of them are
- Strap learning agent to output
- Tell it to make decisions
- Should at least detect active recon, even at slow speeds
- (portscan demo shows high central spike)

What else: diagnostics
- Changes in traffic across a network change "power law profile"
- Are all the changes where you expect?
- Is someone doing something to your systems when they're not around?  Not physically present?

What else: User IDing
- Natural systems aren't just networks
- User interaction with a computer is too
- You can profile a user's keystrokes
- Profile your own keystrokes
- Have your own laptop/pc as a honeypot

What else: much more
- Very early days for power law based analysis
- Possible that all kinds of computer metrics are power law compliant
- Experiment
- It's cheap, fast, simple, so why not?

### Zombie Chrome Extensions - Tomer Cohen R&D Security Team Leader, Wix.com
Chrome bots which increase apparent signups, versus legit traffic

Investigating attack patterns
- Most increase comes from Latin America
- Signup requests come from an iframe in a WiX signup page in FB
- Suspicous users signup then publish a new WiX page within 10 seconds
- The published websites were "How does it work?  If you want to see your profile on FB, click Start and download Chrome Extension to do it.  Viad30 Unlocker" - gets more views or some similar promise.

Viad30
- It injects code into FB tabs
- Opens a WiX iframe transparently inside FB via chrome ext markup injection
- Sends signup request to WiX
- Why? Chrome ext don't have same-origin restriction
- All published sites lead back to the same attack page
- It distributes the link to itself to all the victim's friends
- Reviews the extension in Google Web Store

Why do it like this?  Why WiX.com?
- Wix was used as a supplier of disposable URLs
- Each newly created website provided a new URL basis
- FB didn't recognize that pattern, and allowed those URLs

This was only the infection phase. These bots were used for more.
- Send Spam, DDoS, Scrape Websites, Click Frauds
- Put the bots up for rent

Timeline
April 2016:  "Facebook 'Comment Tagging Malware' spreading via google chrohme"

"Tag me if you can" attack according to Kaspersky

- Victim gets a notification on FB, saying you were mentioned in a comment
- Clicking that, you get a .jse file, which runs a malware to crash Chrome
- The malware copies the Chrome process file, starts a new Chrome with the extension installed
- New copy of .jse is uploaded to user's Google Drive
- Then uses FB's API to tag all friends with that .jse Google Drive URL
- Repeat from "Victim gets a notification" above
- Exponential growth

Bacground script
chrome.tags.onUpdated.addListener(function() ...
 var xhr_obj = asdfasdf();
 xhr_obj['onreadystatechange'] = function() {
   ifxhr_obj['readyState'] == 4) {
     chrome['tabs']['executeScript'] ...

How can we make it easier?
- Smuggling an extension to Google Web Store, keeping it up to date, is a lot of effort
- By using XSS to form a botnet
- Adobe Acrobat extension XSS (Jan 2016). Embed an exploit into a PDF file.
- window.open("chrome-extension://.asdfasdfasdf/frame.js
  open = request.panel_op
  switch(op) { ...
    case "request" : ....
- CSP on extensions by default since 2014
- Prevents common JS injections
  - Inline scripts, eval
  - whitelist script sources only


AVG Web Tuneup XSS
- Attack page adds a listener to a webpage
- window.postMessage(payload) to the AVG Web Tuneup extension embedded in the page
- The AVG extension is vulnerable

### Weaponizing AI - Bishop Fox

Hacking into the database
- AI is trying variants on a SQL string, looking for a tablename that exists in the sqlite_master table
- The AI learned how to look for an attack vector ?
- 200 lines of py
- Takes existing ML methodology and applying it to hacking
- "It has to discover the data on its own."
- "This might seem magical, or special and scary to you"
- Please, be more patronizing

The Model
Regular program: Code -> Binary -> Action
AI program:      (Code, Data) -> Model -> Action

Difficult to enumerate all possible states


### 25 Years of Program Analysis
Blind trust of a program by the monitor|kernel was common back to the 60s and earlier.

You have a potentially vulnerable program, and want to analyse it.
It's composed of "basic blocks" which are executed all together
  x = input() # single basic block, a statement
  if x== 42:
    print "Correct"
  else:
    print "No"

Each of these blocks has a constraint attached to it.  Depending on the input() value, it'll execute differently.
