# Exam Taking Strategies


## Exams are on a curve

- You want to aim for above 70%
- There's no set passing score
- If you get a very low score you could still pass
- You get your score


## Tips

- Read the question carefully
  - Seriously
  - All of it
- Read the answers
- Use process of elimination
- **Refer to other questions**
  - you can go back and forth between questions
- Time management is critical
- When in doubt **GUESS**



## Test Axioms

- "Single AZ": NEVER the right answer
- Using AWS managed services should always be preferred
  - RDS over setting up a database on EC2
- Fault Tolerance is DIFFERENT THAN Fault Tolerance
  - HA == Multiple AZs
  - Fault Tolerant = What happens when everything everywhere goes down
