This framework emphasizes clarity, focus, and continuous improvement. The Deliberate Practice Implementation Framework This framework is designed to be cyclical, allowing for ongoing refinement and growth. Phase 1: Foundation & Goal Setting (The \"What\" and \"Why\") Choose Your Domain and Specific Skill: Action : Select ONE area you genuinely want to improve in (e.g., playing a musical instrument, coding, public speaking, a specific sport, writing). Then, narrow it down: Within that domain, pick a highly specific skill to start with. For example, instead of \"get better at guitar,\" choose \"mastering smooth transitions between G, C, and D chords\" or \"improving accuracy on 16th note runs at 80 bpm.\" Why : Specificity makes practice design and progress measurement possible. Define Your Motivation & Long-Term Vision: Action : Ask yourself why you want to improve this skill. What does achieving a higher level of competence look like? How will it benefit you? Why : Deliberate practice is effortful. A clear vision will provide the motivation needed to persevere through challenges. Establish a Baseline: Action : Honestly assess your current ability in the specific skill you've chosen. This could involve recording yourself, taking a test, or having an expert evaluate you. Why : You need to know where you're starting to design appropriate challenges and measure progress. Phase 2: Designing Your Practice (The \"How\") Break Down the Skill Further (Micro-Skills): Action : Identify the constituent parts of your chosen specific skill. What are the fundamental building blocks or techniques required? For chord transitions, it might be finger placement, pressure, and speed for each finger. Why : This allows you to isolate weak points and practice them individually. Set Hyper-Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART) Goals for Practice Sessions: Action : For each practice session or a short series of sessions, define exactly what you aim to achieve. Example : \"In today's 20-minute session, I will cleanly execute the G to C chord transition 15 times in a row without looking at my fingers, maintaining a steady rhythm.\" Why : Clear goals direct your focus and make success (or the need for adjustment) obvious. Identify Your \"Stretch Zone\" (Challenge Level): Action : Design practice tasks that are just beyond your current level of comfort and competence. You should expect to make mistakes \u2013 that\u2019s where learning happens. The task should require your full concentration. If it's too easy: You're not learning effectively. If it's overwhelmingly difficult: You might get frustrated and make little progress. Adjust accordingly. Why : This is the core of deliberate practice \u2013 pushing boundaries to build new capabilities. Plan Your Feedback Mechanism: Action : Determine how you will get immediate and informative feedback on your performance during and after your practice. This could be: Coach/Mentor: Ideal for expert, personalized feedback. Recordings: Video or audio of yourself to review critically. Software/Apps: Many tools offer immediate feedback (e.g., music practice apps, coding challenges with auto-graders). Comparisons: Compare your work to high-quality examples or models. Self-Correction Checklists: Predetermined criteria for success. Why : Feedback tells you what's working, what's not, and what to adjust. Without it, you might be ingraining errors. Phase 3: Execution & Focus (The \"Doing\") Schedule Dedicated Practice Time: Action : Treat your deliberate practice sessions like important appointments. Block out time in your calendar. Even short, consistent sessions (e.g., 15-25 minutes of intense focus) are more effective than infrequent, long, unfocused ones. Why : Consistency is key to building momentum and skill. Eliminate Distractions & Maximize Concentration: Action : Before you begin, create an environment conducive to deep focus. Turn off notifications, close irrelevant tabs, and let others know you shouldn't be disturbed. Why : Deliberate practice requires intense cognitive effort. Distractions break this focus and reduce effectiveness. Engage in Repetition with Refinement: Action : Perform the practice task repeatedly, but with a crucial difference from mindless repetition: each time, focus on improving a specific aspect based on your goals and the feedback you're getting. Why : The goal isn't just to repeat, but to repeat better each time. Phase 4: Reflection & Adaptation (The \"Learning and Adjusting\") Immediate Post-Practice Review: Action : Right after your session, review your performance and the feedback you gathered. What went well? What were the primary errors or challenges? What did you learn? Why : Capturing insights while the experience is fresh is crucial for learning. Analyze Mistakes Constructively: Action : Don't just note errors; try to understand why they happened. Were they due to a lack of attention, a misunderstanding of a concept, a physical technique issue? Why : Understanding the root cause allows you to make targeted adjustments. Plan Adjustments for Next Session: Action : Based on your review and analysis, decide what you will do differently in your next practice session. Will you slow down? Focus on a different micro-skill? Try a different technique? Slightly increase or decrease the challenge? Why : This iterative process of practice-feedback-adjustment is what drives improvement. Phase 5: Sustainability & Growth (The \"Long Game\") Track Your Progress Over Time: Action : Keep a practice journal or log. Note your goals, what you did, key insights, and observed improvements (or persistent challenges). Why : This helps you see how far you've come (motivating!) and identify broader patterns in your learning. Gradually Increase Challenge: Action : As you master current challenges, continue to push your boundaries by increasing the difficulty or complexity of your practice tasks. Why : To continue improving, you must continue to operate in your \"stretch zone.\" Maintain Consistency and Be Patient: Action : Stick with it. Meaningful skill development through deliberate practice is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be plateaus and frustrations. Why : Expertise is built through sustained, focused effort over time. By following this framework, you can move from simply \"practicing\" to engaging in true \"deliberate practice,\" significantly enhancing your rate of skill acquisition and overall performance. Remember to be kind to yourself; this process is challenging by nature.

Let's break this down. My Resources for Generating the Framework As a large language model, I don't \"use\" resources in the same way a human performs a web search for each query. Instead, my knowledge comes from the massive dataset I was trained on by Google. This dataset includes a vast range of text and code, encompassing books, articles, websites, and research papers. The framework and advice I provided on deliberate practice are synthesized from information that aligns with the foundational research and writings of key figures in the field, most notably: Dr. Anders Ericsson : He is the pioneering researcher who, along with his colleagues, developed the concept of \"deliberate practice.\" His book \"Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise\" (co-authored with Robert Pool) is the most definitive and comprehensive resource on the topic. My understanding of the core principles (specific goals, focused attention, operating outside the comfort zone, immediate feedback, repetition, and refinement) is heavily informed by his work. Authors who have popularized and expanded on these ideas : Cal Newport (\"Deep Work,\" \"So Good They Can't Ignore You\"): Emphasizes the intense focus required, which is a hallmark of deliberate practice. James Clear (\"Atomic Habits\"): Discusses deliberate practice in the context of habit formation and continuous improvement, offering practical strategies. Daniel Coyle (\"The Talent Code\"): Explores the neurological basis of skill acquisition (myelin) through targeted practice. Geoff Colvin (\"Talent Is Overrated\"): Argues for the primacy of deliberate practice over innate talent. So, when I generate a framework or answer your questions, I'm drawing upon this extensive knowledge base, aiming to provide information that is consistent with the established principles and findings from these and other experts in psychology, performance, and learning. Now, let's address your specific questions on how to get a deeper understanding and apply deliberate practice effectively: 1. Identify when I am doing deliberate practice and when I am not meeting the bar. This is a crucial distinction. Here's how to tell: Are you doing Deliberate Practice? Check for these: Specific Goal : Do you have a very clear, narrowly defined goal for this specific session that aims to improve a particular aspect of your skill? (e.g., \"Improve the intonation of this specific musical phrase,\" not just \"practice violin.\") Outside Comfort Zone : Does the task feel challenging? Are you operating at the edge of your current abilities, where you're likely to make mistakes? If it feels easy or automatic, it's not deliberate practice. Intense Focus & Full Concentration : Are you 100% mentally engaged, free from distractions? Deliberate practice is mentally draining because it requires this level of attention. Feedback Mechanism in Place : Are you getting immediate, or near-immediate, feedback on your performance? This could be from a coach, a recording, objective results, or careful self-correction against a model. Repetition with Refinement : Are you repeating the task with the specific intention of correcting errors and improving based on feedback? It's not just mindless repetition. Awareness & Reflection : Are you actively thinking about what you're doing, noticing errors, and considering how to improve? You are likely NOT meeting the bar if: You're on Autopilot/Mindless Repetition : Just going through the motions without focused attention or a specific goal. It Feels Easy or Comfortable : You're likely practicing things you're already good at. No Clear Goal for the Session : You're just \"putting in time.\" No Feedback Loop : You're not sure if you're doing it right or how to improve. Distracted Practice : Your attention is divided. Practicing for Performance/Play : While valuable, performing or simply playing/engaging in the activity for enjoyment is different from practice designed explicitly to improve specific weaknesses. Self-Check Question : \"If I continue practicing this way for the next month, will I be significantly better at this specific, targeted aspect of my skill, or will I just be reinforcing what I already know?\" 2. Identify ways to optimize my practice time. Optimization in deliberate practice is about maximizing the quality and impact of your focused effort, not just cramming in more hours. Pre-Session Planning (5-10 minutes) : Clearly define your single, specific goal for the session. Identify the exact task(s) that will target this goal. Determine your feedback mechanism. Set a realistic duration for focused work. Minimize Transition Time & Distractions : Have everything you need ready before you start. Create a distraction-free environment. This maximizes your \"time on task\" with full concentration. Focus on Your Weakest Links : Deliberate practice yields the most significant gains when applied to the specific sub-skills that are holding you back. Don't just practice what you enjoy or are already good at. Interleave When Appropriate (Advanced) : For some skills, practicing different but related sub-skills in an interleaved fashion (rather than blocked practice of one thing) can lead to better long-term retention, though it might feel harder initially. This depends on the skill. Immediate Post-Session Review (5 minutes) : Briefly note what went well, what challenges arose, and what you learned. This helps consolidate learning and informs your next session. Quality over Quantity : 20 minutes of intensely focused deliberate practice is far more valuable than 2 hours of distracted, unfocused \"practice.\" 3. Identify activities that would benefit. Deliberate practice is most effective for skills that: Are Well-Defined and Can Be Broken Down : Skills that have clear components and sub-skills that can be practiced in isolation (e.g., musical instruments, sports techniques, chess, math problem-solving, surgical procedures, writing specific elements like clear topic sentences). Have Established Standards of Performance : Where there are clear criteria for what \"good\" looks like, allowing for objective feedback. Allow for Repetition and Refinement : You can perform the skill or its components multiple times to work on improving. Benefit from Expert Coaching/Feedback : While not always essential (self-feedback can be developed), skills where expert coaches exist often see faster improvement with deliberate practice under guidance. Are Performance-Oriented : Where the goal is to improve how well you do something. Examples : * Playing a musical instrument * Mastering a specific sports technique (e.g., a tennis serve, a golf swing) * Learning a new language (pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary recall) * Coding or programming (specific algorithms, debugging techniques) * Public speaking (delivery, structure, handling Q&A) * Writing (crafting clear arguments, specific stylistic elements) * Chess or other strategy games * Mathematical problem-solving Activities that are less about repeatable skill and more about creativity in the moment, luck, or very broad, ill-defined \"soft skills\" (without breaking them down) are harder to apply deliberate practice to directly, though components might be. 4. Select the best times in my day and week to engage in deliberate practice. This is highly individual, but here are key principles: When Mentally Fresh & Alert : Deliberate practice is cognitively demanding. Schedule it when you have the most mental energy. For many, this is earlier in the day (morning or after a good break). Avoid times when you're already tired or mentally fatigued. When Interruptions are Minimal : Choose a time when you're least likely to be disturbed. This might mean early mornings, late evenings (if you're a night owl and still fresh), or dedicated blocks during the workday if your schedule allows. Consistency is Key : It's often better to have shorter, regular sessions (e.g., 30-60 minutes daily) than very long, infrequent ones. This helps build habits and allows for daily consolidation of learning. Experiment and Observe : Pay attention to your own energy cycles and focus levels. Try different times and see when you feel most capable of intense concentration. Before or After Other Demanding Tasks : Consider how it fits with other cognitively demanding activities. You might not want to do it immediately after another exhausting mental task. Some find it good to do it before less demanding work. 5. Plan practice sessions quickly and fully, hitting the balance. The goal is a plan that provides structure and focus without becoming overly bureaucratic. Simple Planning Template (Mental or Written) : Overall Skill : [Your broader skill area] Session Date & Duration : [e.g., May 16, 25 minutes] Specific Goal for This Session : [What one specific thing will I improve? Make it measurable.] Example : \"Reduce hesitation in the A-minor to E-major guitar chord change.\" Targeted Task(s) : [What exact exercise(s) will I do?] Example : \"Slow, deliberate A-minor to E-major changes with a metronome at 40bpm, focusing on finger placement economy.\" Challenge Level Check : Is this slightly beyond my current easy reach? Yes/No. (Adjust if 'No') Feedback Method : [How will I know if I'm succeeding/failing and what to correct?] Example : \"Listen for buzzing, watch finger movement for efficiency, record and review if needed.\" Metric for Success (Optional but good) : [How will I quantify improvement in this session?] Example : \"Achieve 10 consecutive clean changes.\" Hitting the Balance : Focused enough : The goal and tasks should be narrow. Challenging enough : It should require effort and concentration. Not overwhelming : The goal should be achievable within the session or a few sessions. Break down bigger goals. Quick to plan : Once you get used to it, this mental checklist should take only a few minutes. Don't let planning become a form of procrastination. 6. Identify the maximum I can do per day and per week, and ensure I am getting close to the max deliberate practice out of my brain, since time cannot be replaced. This is a critical point, and the answer isn't about \"maxing out\" hours in the traditional sense. Quality trumps sheer quantity. Deliberate Practice is Highly Fatiguing : Because it requires intense concentration and operating at the edge of your abilities, it's mentally exhausting. Limits of Focused Attention : Anders Ericsson's research suggests that even top performers can only sustain true deliberate practice for a limited number of hours per day, often in focused bursts. For many, this might be 1-4 hours per day , broken into sessions. Beginners will likely have lower limits. These sessions are typically 60-90 minutes at most , followed by a break, as concentration wanes. Some prefer shorter, more frequent bursts (e.g., 20-30 minutes). Signs You're Reaching Your Daily/Weekly Limit (or Pushing Too Hard) : Inability to maintain focus; easily distracted. Performance starts to degrade despite effort. Increased frustration or irritability during practice. Feeling mentally \"fried\" or exhausted rather than productively tired. Lack of enjoyment or dreading practice (while it's hard, it shouldn't always feel like torture). Physical symptoms if the skill is physical (e.g., strain, pain from overuse). Sleep disturbances or difficulty recovering. Focus on Optimal, Sustainable Practice, Not \"Maxing Out\" : The goal is the most effective practice you can sustain over the long term. Pushing for \"maximum hours\" can lead to burnout, reduced quality of practice, and even injury or demotivation, which ultimately wastes more time. Listen to your body and mind. When your ability to concentrate significantly drops, it's more productive to take a break or stop for the day. Importance of Rest and Recovery : Your brain consolidates learning during rest and sleep. Insufficient recovery will impair your progress. Mental breaks between focused sessions are crucial. Gradual Increase : As your capacity for focused attention improves with training (just like a muscle), you might be able to handle slightly longer or more frequent sessions, but always prioritize quality. \"Time cannot be replaced,\" so use it WISELY : The wisest use of time for skill development is high-quality, focused deliberate practice within your sustainable limits, coupled with adequate rest for consolidation and recovery. Trying to cram more low-quality, fatigued \"practice\" is counterproductive. Instead of aiming for \"max deliberate practice out of your brain,\" aim for the highest quality deliberate practice your brain can productively engage in and recover from, consistently over time . This will yield far better results in the long run. Further Insightful Questions You Might Consider You've already asked a very comprehensive and insightful set of questions that get to the heart of understanding and implementing deliberate practice effectively! They cover the core mechanics, planning, optimization, and self-awareness needed. However, since you're looking for even deeper understanding, here are a few more insightful questions that build upon your excellent foundation, categorized for clarity. These could help refine and sustain your journey towards true expertise. 1. Navigating Challenges and Advanced Application: \"Beyond adjusting task difficulty, what specific strategies can be employed to systematically diagnose and overcome persistent learning plateaus when engaged in deliberate practice over a long period?\" \"How can one effectively adapt the principles of deliberate practice to domains that are inherently less structured, more creative, or involve complex, dynamic social interactions where immediate, objective feedback is challenging to obtain?\" \"What is the optimal way to cycle between periods of intense deliberate practice and periods of rest, consolidation, or even 'playful' engagement with the skill to maximize long-term growth and prevent burnout?\" 2. The Role of Feedback and Self-Correction at an Advanced Level: \"For skills where expert coaching is unavailable or unaffordable, what advanced techniques can individuals develop to become exceptionally skilled at self-critique and generating their own accurate feedback loops?\" \"How should one approach and integrate conflicting pieces of feedback from different credible sources (e.g., multiple mentors, objective data, peer review) to make the most informed adjustments to their practice?\" 3.

Instead, my knowledge comes from the massive dataset I was trained on by Google. This dataset includes a vast range of text and code, encompassing books, articles, websites, and research papers. The framework and advice I provided on deliberate practice are synthesized from information that aligns with the foundational research and writings of key figures in the field, most notably: Dr. Anders Ericsson : He is the pioneering researcher who, along with his colleagues, developed the concept of \"deliberate practice.\" His book \"Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise\" (co-authored with Robert Pool) is the most definitive and comprehensive resource on the topic. My understanding of the core principles (specific goals, focused attention, operating outside the comfort zone, immediate feedback, repetition, and refinement) is heavily informed by his work. Authors who have popularized and expanded on these ideas : Cal Newport (\"Deep Work,\" \"So Good They Can't Ignore You\"): Emphasizes the intense focus required, which is a hallmark of deliberate practice. James Clear (\"Atomic Habits\"): Discusses deliberate practice in the context of habit formation and continuous improvement, offering practical strategies. Daniel Coyle (\"The Talent Code\"): Explores the neurological basis of skill acquisition (myelin) through targeted practice. Geoff Colvin (\"Talent Is Overrated\"): Argues for the primacy of deliberate practice over innate talent. So, when I generate a framework or answer your questions, I'm drawing upon this extensive knowledge base, aiming to provide information that is consistent with the established principles and findings from these and other experts in psychology, performance, and learning. Now, let's address your specific questions on how to get a deeper understanding and apply deliberate practice effectively:","title":"My Resources for Generating the Framework"},{"location":"docs/deliberate-practice/implementing-deliberate-practice/#1-identify-when-i-am-doing-deliberate-practice-and-when-i-am-not-meeting-the-bar","text":"This is a crucial distinction. Here's how to tell: Are you doing Deliberate Practice? Check for these: Specific Goal : Do you have a very clear, narrowly defined goal for this specific session that aims to improve a particular aspect of your skill? (e.g., \"Improve the intonation of this specific musical phrase,\" not just \"practice violin.\") Outside Comfort Zone : Does the task feel challenging? Are you operating at the edge of your current abilities, where you're likely to make mistakes? If it feels easy or automatic, it's not deliberate practice. Intense Focus & Full Concentration : Are you 100% mentally engaged, free from distractions? Deliberate practice is mentally draining because it requires this level of attention. Feedback Mechanism in Place : Are you getting immediate, or near-immediate, feedback on your performance? This could be from a coach, a recording, objective results, or careful self-correction against a model. Repetition with Refinement : Are you repeating the task with the specific intention of correcting errors and improving based on feedback? It's not just mindless repetition. Awareness & Reflection : Are you actively thinking about what you're doing, noticing errors, and considering how to improve? You are likely NOT meeting the bar if: You're on Autopilot/Mindless Repetition : Just going through the motions without focused attention or a specific goal. It Feels Easy or Comfortable : You're likely practicing things you're already good at. No Clear Goal for the Session : You're just \"putting in time.\" No Feedback Loop : You're not sure if you're doing it right or how to improve. Distracted Practice : Your attention is divided. Practicing for Performance/Play : While valuable, performing or simply playing/engaging in the activity for enjoyment is different from practice designed explicitly to improve specific weaknesses. Self-Check Question : \"If I continue practicing this way for the next month, will I be significantly better at this specific, targeted aspect of my skill, or will I just be reinforcing what I already know?\"","title":"1.

Pre-Session Planning (5-10 minutes) : Clearly define your single, specific goal for the session. Identify the exact task(s) that will target this goal. Determine your feedback mechanism. Set a realistic duration for focused work. Minimize Transition Time & Distractions : Have everything you need ready before you start. Create a distraction-free environment. This maximizes your \"time on task\" with full concentration. Focus on Your Weakest Links : Deliberate practice yields the most significant gains when applied to the specific sub-skills that are holding you back. Don't just practice what you enjoy or are already good at. Interleave When Appropriate (Advanced) : For some skills, practicing different but related sub-skills in an interleaved fashion (rather than blocked practice of one thing) can lead to better long-term retention, though it might feel harder initially. This depends on the skill. Immediate Post-Session Review (5 minutes) : Briefly note what went well, what challenges arose, and what you learned. This helps consolidate learning and informs your next session. Quality over Quantity : 20 minutes of intensely focused deliberate practice is far more valuable than 2 hours of distracted, unfocused \"practice.\"","title":"2.

Have Established Standards of Performance : Where there are clear criteria for what \"good\" looks like, allowing for objective feedback. Allow for Repetition and Refinement : You can perform the skill or its components multiple times to work on improving. Benefit from Expert Coaching/Feedback : While not always essential (self-feedback can be developed), skills where expert coaches exist often see faster improvement with deliberate practice under guidance. Are Performance-Oriented : Where the goal is to improve how well you do something. Examples : * Playing a musical instrument * Mastering a specific sports technique (e.g., a tennis serve, a golf swing) * Learning a new language (pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary recall) * Coding or programming (specific algorithms, debugging techniques) * Public speaking (delivery, structure, handling Q&A) * Writing (crafting clear arguments, specific stylistic elements) * Chess or other strategy games * Mathematical problem-solving Activities that are less about repeatable skill and more about creativity in the moment, luck, or very broad, ill-defined \"soft skills\" (without breaking them down) are harder to apply deliberate practice to directly, though components might be.","title":"3.

Schedule it when you have the most mental energy. For many, this is earlier in the day (morning or after a good break). Avoid times when you're already tired or mentally fatigued. When Interruptions are Minimal : Choose a time when you're least likely to be disturbed. This might mean early mornings, late evenings (if you're a night owl and still fresh), or dedicated blocks during the workday if your schedule allows. Consistency is Key : It's often better to have shorter, regular sessions (e.g., 30-60 minutes daily) than very long, infrequent ones. This helps build habits and allows for daily consolidation of learning. Experiment and Observe : Pay attention to your own energy cycles and focus levels. Try different times and see when you feel most capable of intense concentration. Before or After Other Demanding Tasks : Consider how it fits with other cognitively demanding activities. You might not want to do it immediately after another exhausting mental task. Some find it good to do it before less demanding work.","title":"4.

Challenging enough : It should require effort and concentration. Not overwhelming : The goal should be achievable within the session or a few sessions. Break down bigger goals.

Quality trumps sheer quantity. Deliberate Practice is Highly Fatiguing : Because it requires intense concentration and operating at the edge of your abilities, it's mentally exhausting. Limits of Focused Attention : Anders Ericsson's research suggests that even top performers can only sustain true deliberate practice for a limited number of hours per day, often in focused bursts. For many, this might be 1-4 hours per day , broken into sessions. Beginners will likely have lower limits. These sessions are typically 60-90 minutes at most , followed by a break, as concentration wanes. Some prefer shorter, more frequent bursts (e.g., 20-30 minutes). Signs You're Reaching Your Daily/Weekly Limit (or Pushing Too Hard) : Inability to maintain focus; easily distracted. Performance starts to degrade despite effort. Increased frustration or irritability during practice. Feeling mentally \"fried\" or exhausted rather than productively tired. Lack of enjoyment or dreading practice (while it's hard, it shouldn't always feel like torture). Physical symptoms if the skill is physical (e.g., strain, pain from overuse). Sleep disturbances or difficulty recovering. Focus on Optimal, Sustainable Practice, Not \"Maxing Out\" : The goal is the most effective practice you can sustain over the long term. Pushing for \"maximum hours\" can lead to burnout, reduced quality of practice, and even injury or demotivation, which ultimately wastes more time. Listen to your body and mind. When your ability to concentrate significantly drops, it's more productive to take a break or stop for the day. Importance of Rest and Recovery : Your brain consolidates learning during rest and sleep. Insufficient recovery will impair your progress. Mental breaks between focused sessions are crucial. Gradual Increase : As your capacity for focused attention improves with training (just like a muscle), you might be able to handle slightly longer or more frequent sessions, but always prioritize quality. \"Time cannot be replaced,\" so use it WISELY : The wisest use of time for skill development is high-quality, focused deliberate practice within your sustainable limits, coupled with adequate rest for consolidation and recovery. Trying to cram more low-quality, fatigued \"practice\" is counterproductive. Instead of aiming for \"max deliberate practice out of your brain,\" aim for the highest quality deliberate practice your brain can productively engage in and recover from, consistently over time . This will yield far better results in the long run.","title":"6.

Contents components of a compiler environment in which a compiler does its job tools to make it easier to build compilers 1.1 Compilers compiler - a program that reads a program written in the source language and translates it into an equivalent target program in the target language . The compiler reports errors in the source program as error messages . \"basic tasks\" all compilers perform \"are the same\" Thousands of source languages Target languages include Another programming language Machine language of any computer (microprocessor to supercomputer) Some compiler classifications - based on structure or function single-pass multi-pass load-and-go debugging optimizing etc. advances in compilers: implementation languages programming environments software tools The Analysis-Synthesis Model of Compilation The 2 parts of compilation are analysis and synthesis . Analysis - Break the source program into pieces and create an intermediate representation of the source program . Synthesis - Construct the target program from the intermediate representation * requires the most specialized techniques Analysis Operations of source program are determined & recorded in a tree, (hierarchical structure). Often a syntax tree node == operation children of node == arguments of operation in the text diagram, operations can be arguments: position := initial + rate * 60 Many software tools that manipulate source programs first perform some kind of analysis Structure Editors - text editor + autocomplete + linter + static analysis + etc. real-time partial analysis Pretty Printers - structure viewer for humans Static Checkers - attempt to discover potential bugs without running the program. Similar to optimizing compilers . code that cannot be executed in the course of the program variable used before defined catch logical errors (type checking / use real variable as pointer) Interpreters - Instead of producing target program , perform the operations implied by source program Compilers aren't just for machine code The analysis portion of compiling shows up in these examples: Text formatters - Format text for output in a textual format Silicon compilers - Input is a conventional programming source language . Variables represent signals or signal groups in switching circuits. Outputs a circuit design in an appropriate target language Query interpreters - translates a predicate containing relational and boolean operators into commands to search a database for records satisfying the predicate The Context of a Compiler Other programs may be needed to create the executable target program. A preprocessor might: collect parts of the source program stored in separate files expand macros into source language statements. See fig 1.3 page 4. A target program may require further processing to run. assembler - translate assembly to machine code linker - link to library routines 1.2 Analysis of the source program Introducing analysis and illustrate its use in some text-formatting languages . Also see chapters 2-4, 6. Three Phases of Analysis Linear Analysis AKA: lexical analysis or scanning read stream of source program left-to-right and group into tokens , streams of characters, with collective meaning Hierarchical Analysis AKA: syntax analysis or parsing hierarchically group characters/tokens into meaningful nested collections Semantic Analysis find semantic errors, identify operands, type checking check that components of a program fit together meaningfully Lexical Analysis Linear analysis is called lexical analysis or scanning . See example page 5. Create tokens from the source program stream. Discard separators, e.g. whitespace. Syntax Analysis Hierarchical Analsysis is called parsing or syntax analysis . Group the tokens into grammatical phrases for the compiler to synthesize output. Usually the grammatical phrases are represented by a parse tree or a syntax tree . parse tree - statements , expressions , and identifers are all nodes. A precise definition is not given, see fig. 1.4, page 6. syntax tree - Compressed representation of a parse tree. Operators appear as interior nodes and operands are the children of that operator's node. See Section 5.2 . There is a good example here, page 6. expressions , recursive rules , (nonrecursive) basis rules , and definition rules , and statements are described in the example but not introduced as formal terms. The division between lexical and syntactic analysis is somewhat arbitrary. We usually choose a division that simplifies the overall task of analysis. Factors for division between lexical and syntactic analysis: Is the source language construct recursive or not? Lexical constructs - do not require recursion . identifiers - strings of letters+digits beginning with a letter recursion not necessary to recognize identifiers , typically scan until non-(letter+number) and group back to beginning the grouped characters are recorded in a symbol table and removed from the input (so the pointer is back at the beginning) the next token is then processed. Syntactic constructs often require recursion . linear scan cannot analyze expressions or statements cannot match parentheses in expressions cannot match begin and end in statements unless there is a hierarchical or nesting structure ON the input Context-free grammars - formalization of recursive rule that can be used to guide syntactic analysis See chapter 2 for introduction, chapter 4 for extensive treatment. Syntax-directed translation The compiler uses the hierarchical structure on the input to help generate the output . See: Chapters 2, 5. Semantic Analysis check source program for semantic errors gather type information for subsequent code-generation phase use hierarchical structure determined by syntax-analysis phase to identify operators and operands of expressions and statements type checking : compiler checks that each operator has permitted operands based on source language specification. Must also check for operator coercions. Part of semantic analysis , see ch. 6. example: binary arithmetic operator applied to integer & real, converts integer to real, see example 1.1 and fig. 1.5 inttoreal Analysis in Text Formatters TEX uses hierarchical arrangement in boxes as part of the syntax analysis to describe the relative position of groups of vertical and horizontal characters. See p.8-9 for fig 1.6-1.7. 1.3 The Phases of a Compiler A compiler operates in conceptual phases . Each transforms the source program from one representation to another. Some phases may be grouped together. Intermediate representations between grouped phases need not be explicity constructed. See fig. 1.9, page 10 for a \"typical decomposition of a compiler\". Phases There are six phases between source program and target program : Lexical Analyzer Syntax Analyzer Semantic Analyzer Intermediate Code Generator Code Optimizer Code Generator See figure 1.10 , page 13, for a detailed translation of position := initial + rate * 60 . Supplementary Phases (used during every phase) Symbol-table manager Error handler Symbol-Table Management Symbol Table : data structure containing a record for each identifier with fields for the attributes of the identifier. Quickly find, store, and retrieve data for that identifier. The identifier is added by the lexical analyzer but the identifier's attributes are typically added and consumed during later phases. An attribute could be something like storage, scope, type. If the identifier is a procedure: perhaps number and type of arguments, method of passing arguments (by reference, etc.), and type returned, if any. See chapters: 2, 7 for more about symbol tables. Error Detection and Reporting Each phase must encounter and deal with errors, and potentially proceed. The syntax analyzer and semantic analyzer typically handle a large fraction of errors. The lexical analyzer may encounter errors when remaining characters do not form a token. The syntax analyser finds errors where the token stream violates the structure rules. The semantic analyzer can find errors where a meaningless operation occurs, e.g. add an array to the name of a procedure. Further discussion of errors for each phase is included in the part of the book devoted to that phase. The Analysis Phase As translation progresses, the compiler's representatin of the source program changes. note: In this diagram and chapter, the intermediate representation is considered/proxied as the syntax tree and symbol table . The data structure for the tree in fig. 1.10 is shown in fig. 1.11b . Lexical analysis is covered in chapter 3. Intermediate Code Generation Some compilers generate an explicit intermediate representation of the source program , \"a program for an abstract machine\". Variety of forms. Chapter 8 covers principle intermediate representations in compilers. Chapters 5, 8 cover algorithms for generating intermedaite code for typical programming language constructs. Properties of an intermediate representation easy to produce easy to translate into the target program Three-address code Three-address code consists of a sequence of instructions, each of which has at most three operands. Assembly language for a machine in which every memory location can act like a register. Code Optimization Goal: improve intermediate code. Simple example on pages 14-15. Chapter 9 discusses simple optimizations. Chapter 10 gives technology used by most powerful optimizing compilers. Code Generation Goal: generate target code from intermediate code . Normally this gives relocateable machine code or assembly code . A crucial aspect is assignment of variables to registers. Simple example on pages 15-16. Chapter 9 covers code generation. 1.4 Cousins of the Compiler This section is about a compiler's typical operating context. Preprocessors Produce the input to compilers. Everything here seems to boil down to macros. Macro processing : allow user to define macros as shorhand for longer constructs. File inclusion : include header files into the program text, e.g. in c language : #include <global.h> is replaced by the contents of global.h \"Rational\" preprocessors : Add capabilities to a language, especially for flow control and data structures. Same as macros functionally? Language Extensions : More macros, different use. See example in book. Example 1.2 on page 16. Assemblers Assembly code is a mnemonic version of machine code , where names are used instead of binary codes for operations . Names are also given to memory addresses . It is customary for assembly languages to have macro facilities that are similar to those in the macro preprocessors described above. Two-pass Assembly Simple assemblers make two passes over the input file, where a pass reads a input file once. The first pass finds and stores identifiers , assigning storage locations in the symbol table . The second pass translates operation code into the bits representing that operation in machine language. It also translates each identifier intot he address given for that identifier in the symbol table . The output of the second pass is usually relocateable machine code , which means it can be loaded starting in any memory location, L, in memory. If L is added to all addresses in the code, all references will be correct. Thus, the output of the assembler must distinguish those portions of instructions that refer to addresses that can be relocated. See example 3, page 18-19. Loaders and Link-editors A loader usually performs both loading and link-editing . loading : Taking relocateable machine code, altering the relocateable address, and placing the altered instructions and data in memory at the proper locations. link-editor : Make a single program from several files of relocateable machine code. Many of the files result from separate compiles, and often are stored in separate locations for system-wide use. e.g. libraries. external reference : code in one file references a location in another file. May be data or an entry point to a procedure. relocateable machine code file must retain the information in the symbol table for: each data location defined in one file and used in another each entry point of a procedure defined in one file and used in another if not known in advance, must include entire symbol table as part of relocateable machine code 1.5 The Grouping of Phases Multiple phases are often grouped together in compiler implementations. Front and Back Ends Front end : largely independent of target machine, based on source language lexical analysis syntactic analysis symbol table creation semantic analysis generate intermediate code Back end : code optimization code generation error handling symbol table operations Fairly routine: keep the front end of a compiler and redo the back end for another machine. Parts of the back end can even be kept. Further discussion in Chapter 9. It is also tempting to compile several different languages into the same intermediate language and use a common back end for the different front ends, thereby obtaining several compilers for one machine. However, because of subtle differences in the viewpoints of different languages, there has been only limited success in this direction. Passes Many phases can be done in one pass. Organizing phases into passes is complex and discussed for some specific implementations in chapter 12. The whole back end may be one pass, immedately producing intermediate code . We may think of the syntax analyzer as being 'in charge'. As it discovers grammatical structure, the parser can call intermediate code generation. See chapter 2 for a compiler with this implementation. Reducing the Number of Passes Goal: Have relatively few passes. Goal: Don't use up all the system memory. Reconciling these could create tension. The interface between the lexical and syntactic analyzers can often be limited to a single token. It is often very hard to perform code generation until the intermediate representation has been completely generated. backpatching : merge intermediate code and target code generation can often be merged into one pass by creating a slot and filling it once the information becomes available. See the example, page 21. To ensure you do not use too much space, you can reduce the distance over which backpatching occurs. 1.6 Compiler-Construction Tools Chapter eleven discusses software tools for implementing a compiler. There are specialized tools for implementing various phases of a compiler These tools are called variously: compiler-compilers compiler-generators translator-writing systems Specialized tools are typically oriented around a model of languages and are suitable for languages following that model. Tools exist for automatic design of specific compiler components , they use specialized languages for specifying and implementing the component. The most successful hide details of generation algorithm and make components that are easily integrated into the remainder of the compiler. A list of compiler construction tools Parser generators : produce syntax analyzers normally from in put based on context-free grammar . Syntax analysis used to be very time consuming but now is \"one of the easiest phases to implement\". Often parser generators use parsing algorithms too complex to do by hand. Scanner generators : automatically generate lexical analyzers , normally from a specification based on regular expressions . The lexical analyzer is effectively a finite automaton . See chapter 3 , implementations in section 3.5, section 3.8 . Syntax-directed translation engines : produce collections of routines that walk the parse tree, generating intermediate code . One or more translations are associated with each node of the parse tree, each translation defined in terms of its neighbor nodes in the tree. See chapter 5. Automatic code generators : take a collection of rules defining intermediate language -> target language and replace the intermediate rules with templates that represent sequences of machine instructions. Something about tiling intermediate code without a combinatorial explosion in compiler running time. See chapter 9. Data-flow engines : data flow analysis is used in optimization. How are values transmitted from one part of a program to each other part? Especially as the user defines relationships between intermediate code statements and the information being gathered. See Section 10.11. Bibliographic Notes Lots of parallel discovery, hard to attribute credit.

Awakening the Collaborative Spirit Principles and conditions for participants to retain their individuality while combining their efforts and talents in a group in ways vital for collaborative synthesis. Collegial. Open & honest collaboration. Strategy One: Knowing How to See Da Vinci: \"saper vedere\" is knowing how to see first perspective is usually wrong move repeatedly to new perspectives, deepen understanding along the way \"Invitational Stem\" - start problem statement with \"In what ways may I...\" to avoid narrowing the problem statement to one perspective. Human language plays a role: Verbalize and write out a problem (and other ways) -- do not solve silently -- for better outcomes. Don't persist with any one perspective. Try using a whole different system and terms to express the same relationship Restructuring your problems more makes it more likely you will deepen your perspective Ways to restructure your problem: Global and Specific Abstractions Separate the parts from the whole Change the words in some fashion Make positive action statements Switch perspective Use Da Vinci's multiple perspectives Use Questions Global and Specific Abstractions Quip \"Make it more global and specific.\" Tips To widen your perspective use the \"5 whys\": Ask why 5 times to your answer to the previous why. Find the level of abstraction that fits. Ask \"Who, what, when, where, why, how?\" The more specifically you define your problem statement, the easier it will be to generate ideas. (tradeoffs) Trent: Specific statements miss solutions, abstraction may be necessary to discover something great. Summary \"Abstraction is a basic principle in restructuring a problem.\" \"Widening the perspective\", at the maximum \"globalize\" the problem Find the APPROPRIATE level of abstaction. \"Standard procedure for physical science is abstraction.\" Galileo \"ideal vacuum\" thought experiment imagined a large vacuum existed (none was available) all items fall through a vacuum with the same acceleration regardless of their weight More abstract version of \"what weighs more, a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?\" removes the pound: \"what accelerates faster in a vacuum, a feather or a brick?\" (neither) Einstein relativity was also unobservable. \"More specific problem statements lead to faster solutions with less conceptual clarity.\" oil spill: driveway vs gulf coast new keyboard design vs new global IT industry niche Shipping industry too focused on reducing costs of ships Perspective change, global problem statement: \"In what way can the shipping industry lower reduce costs?\" Solution: Separate loading and stowing. Container ships reduced port time, congestion, theft. Ships spend more time traveling ship is \"capital equipment\" - spends more time doing its unique work of moving) costs down 60% Separate the Parts from the Whole Move from one detail to another examining it in isolation from the rest. Fishbone Diagram good for processing a \"north star\" or large vision find relationships between causes and effects use more than one session to work on a diagram let the diagram cook overnight (in your mind) and then return to find your fresh thoughts & ideas Words and Word Chains Aristotle work titled \"On Interpretation\" - words and chains of words are powerful tools of thought both reflect thinking and shape thinking Words crystallize thought, creating precision and rigidity. (both strength and weakness) Rephrase the Problem / Feynman avoid definitions such as \"friction\", \"energy\" (trent: this abstraction can hide important meaning too early) students should rephrase what they learn in their own language example of avoiding \"friction\": shoe soles go flat because notches and bumps in the sidewalk grab pieces and pull them off trent: now we see the sidewalk-shoe interface is more like a slow table saw, scooping a little rubber from various places each step Example: Toyota asked employees a question 2 ways, the 1st failed, the 2nd worked: \"How can you be more productive at work?\" \"How can you make your job easier?\" Change the Words Try changing the verb, it is easier to do. Play with verbs and nouns: Transpose the Words Aristotle \"convertibility\" - \"if every pleasure is good, some good must be pleasure.\" (questionable) find a \"verbal-conceptual chain\" to trigger a \"different view\" \"How can I get a promotion?\" vs \"How can I promote myself?\" interesting relationship even though it's just a random transposition. \"How can I learn to use the internet?\" vs \"How can I use the internet to learn?\" 21 years later this one hits spot on, that's a major use of the internet.

Warby Parker used an internally hosted gitbook to disseminate information about datasets. Resources Wikipedia - Data Dictionary Dan Woods - \"Why You Can't Be Data-driven Without A Data Catalog\" (Wayback Machine Cache Link) In conversations with Carl Anderson, director of data science at Warby Parker, I discovered an elegant approach based on creating an integrated model. Anderson and his team did exhaustive research about the concepts used by executives and analysts to describe and understand business activity. Much of this knowledge was embedded in spreadsheet formulas or handcrafted SQL. Anderson and his team worked with each department to create a common definition of concepts like customer, product and revenue.

Augmenting Human Intellect: Abstract: \"This is an initial summary report of a project taking a new and systematic approach to improving the intellectual effectiveness of the individual human being. A detailed conceptual framekwork explores the nature of the system composed of the individual and the tools, concepts, and methods that match his basic capabilities to his problems. One of the tools that shows the greatest immediate promise is the computer, when it can be harnessed for direct on-line assistance, integrated with new concepts and methods. Part I - Introduction Part 1A - General ( \"Terms and Definitions\" ) Augmenting Human Intellect = \"Increasing a human's ability to...\" Approach a complex problem situation Gain comprehension to suit his needs Derive solutions to problem Increased Capabilities \"Faster, better, beyond original capabilities\" Complex Situations = \"Professional Problems\" Problem scale is 20 minutes to 20 years Means extensions of native sensory, motor, and mental capabilities Improvement Space Visualize this extending from/with the H-LAM/T Capability Space Will cover in section 2 Part 1B - Objective of the Study Find: factors that limit effectiveness of the individual's basic information-handling capabilities in meeting society's needs for problem solving in its most general sense Develop: Techniques, Procedures, Systems - \"which better match these basic capabilities to the needs, problems, and progress of society\" Specifications: Both long- and short-term research goals in augmentation Specific actions in: Work Environment Thinking Skills Methods of working Framework is a basis for: evaluating possible relevance of work/knowledge from existing fields assimilate relevant things from those fields \"Not be in a vacuum of study\" Framework is a basis for choosing starting points reveal areas where research can be done develop methodologies for that research H-LAM/T Conceptual Framework is a \"rudimentary framework\" a place to start at and evolve from Part II - Conceptual Framework Human has: Motor channels: Transmit information Sensory channels: Receive information Human processing: Conscious Processing Unconscious Processing Augmentation Means: Artifacts Language Methodology Organization by methods, procedures, and strategies Training \"Process Hierarchies\" Structure / Organization of each tiny step \"Augmentation Means\" Serve to break down complex problems to tiny steps \" tiny step \" = \"sub-process\" There is no way to \"find the bottom\" of the subprocess tree It is not necessary to start at the bottom A \"simple enough\" bottom layer will do Does Engelbart mean simple enough to describe wholly or pragmatically? May not matter. Begin from basic capabilities : Sensory-Mental-Motor Process Capabilities Add process capabilities of Artifacts Each individual has their own repertoire of process capabilities which are selected and adapted for execution on a process A person and his/her artifacts can be said to have a \"toolkit\" called a repertoire hierarchy which extends from his basic capabilities 3 categories of process capability : Explicit-Human Explicit-Artifact Composite (Human to Artifact Interface) H-LAM/T System - Definition Human using Language, Artifacts, and Methodology in which he is Trained H/LAM-T System - Terms has the capability and uses the repertoire to perform the process Executive processes embody all methodology of H/LAM-T System. Habit Strategy Rules of Thumb Prejudice Learned Method - NOTE: implies training is contained in methodology? Intuition Unconscious Dictates NOTE: Methodology is enumerated above, which leaves only artifacts and language. Is this collection (and any similar extensions) along with artifacts, language enough to embody all interactions a human has with his substrate? Language evolves around systems. Uncovering new systems will resolve new language. What is training then? It seems to be a subset of method but is included in the acronym. Maybe training is intended to be an extension of methods but as a special and critical process for onboarding process capabilities in humans (viewing a human as an artifact as well). There is an analogy Engelbart uses between humans and artifacts, both containing repertoire hierarchies of process capabilities . An artifact is generally designed to execute a process capability . A human can be trained to execute a process capability . A new innovation ripples/propagates both up and down the capability hierarchy . \"Synthesis\" New capabilities from old capabiltiies. Calls for a systems engineering approach. \"Synergy and Synthesis\" - Use metal allow tensile strength analogy to understand how organizing some capabilities can create a radical new \"synthetic capability\" NOTE: This is cribbed BY Buckminster Fuller 's \"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth\". Engelbart was first unless it can be found in an earlier work. Regardless, the idea of alloys having complex new properties is potent. The world still has magic and it is materials engineering. NOTE: It would be nice to have analogies other than materials engineering otherwise we should all just become materials engineers... capabilities are \"changeable parts\" When changed, capabilities explose latent \"synthetic capabilities\" in that \"repertoire hierarchy\" His idea: by changing interchangeable parts, \" side reactions \" or new capabilities can be unearthed. An internal definition for what we call inventing by benevolent mistakes in experiment. Consider the whole H-LAM/T System as an ongoing experiment. NOTE: All humanity is in a PERMANENT , UNIFIED experiment. All action is data. Gather data as such (on the interactions in the system) some data targets: capabilities, effectiveness, etc. As humans have added tools, our common/shared repertoire hierarchies have grown and formed around us. Radical change is the norm. Can we accelerate radical change with guided research? \"Intelligence Amplifier\" Does not imply increasing raw intelligence. An amplifier makes louder what is already there. We seek to amplify intelligence by restructuring the H-LAM/T System. NOTE: He doesn't say repertoire hierarchies here, he says restructure the whole system. NOTE: His hooks for restructure are Language, Artifacts, Methods (including Training). NOTE: So what does he focus on? We could do: automation - move more and more trained methods into artifacts science - create and apply new models and language (math?) to describe the universe applications engineering - human methods seems like the weakest part of H-LAM/T... get a human to do more complex techniques Unless we are already down this rabbit hole and people increasingly program complex capabilities into dynamic artifacts right now NOTE: Often H/LAM-T will exist natively in a poorly built and/or poorly maintained state. Retraining may be 80% of the value of amplification.... sometimes. LAM-T Augmentation means represent the amplifier: Simplified using Doug's definitions: \"The means by which we augment LAM-T are the amplifier\" Simplified more: \"The means are the amplifier\" Man-Artifact Interface: NOTE: Human-Computer Interaction is the field today. This term is derived from industrial revolution term \"man-machine interface\" Two Domains: Human Artifact Explicit-Human processes often exchange across an interface to Explicit-Artifact processes Composite Processes - often designed solely for a functional match, \"coupling\", between the explicit processes . Language evolves to a situation Language can force its users down a way of thinking. Language does exert a force on its own evolution. NOTE: Language evolves to describe new concepts, which is a form of mental modeling of phenomena which can reveal new capabilities and thus contribute to novel processes. NOTE: Human-Language aided thought generates new ways of thinking, new methods, and new processes. These can later be trained or incorporated in artifacts. Capabilities drive actions and drive language evolution \"We offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian Hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and the capability for effective intellectual activity, are directly affected during their evolution by the means by which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols.\" \"Automated external symbol manipulation\" - Synmbols which humans represents concepts he is manipulating can be rearranged before his eyes. Essentially giant trees of words and concepts that can uncover new language automatically by processing the base concepts of current language. Note that in the next paragraph, Doug predicts the action of using google on a smartphone to search a term in real time. To some degree we are already living in a much more fluid-language world. Question: How would having a complete, fast dictionary impact language evolution? NOTE: See encyclopedia dramatica, urban dictionary. People try to redefine things to what they want them to mean all the time, today. Terminology enters the zeitgeist very quickly but fades as quickly and terms often have different meanings to different clades. See: \"Safe Space\", 2016 representations and attacks. Organizations have to maintain internal definitions to be able to communicate. Two points in designing new repertoire hierarchies: Materials - fundamental capabilities from which all others must be constructed. Decomposition Search Decompose capabilities to discover new materials (see: synthetic capabilities) De Novo - e.g. Materials Engineering (other analogies?) Principles - Structures, explicitly synergetic structures \"synergism\" used by biologists and physicists for a siimilar concept: Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (quote from paper): \"...cooperative action of discrete agencies such that the total effect is greater than the sum of the two effects taken independently...\" Synergy is important because it is the threshold beyond which the means become greater than the sum of their materials. Five tentative types of structure: Mental Concept Symbol Process Physical Human contributes many types of capability... \"wears many hats\" A complex capability has two classes of capability (NOTE: manager vs employee) Executive class Direct contributive class Repertoire Hierarchy (sic) A mountain of white collar talent that sits atop and controls the talens of the \"workers\" Goal: Maximize productivity, Gain comprehension, Solve problems. Engelbart sees the production work as a flat base layer with a pyramid of white collar talent on top \"Theorem\" - We could expect significant gains from improving symbol and process structuring. Finding: Humans switch frequently between one symbol structure and another continuously. \"Human Augmentation Means\" will require: Training Mental Tricks Improved Language New Methodology \"Unconscious Processes may be important\" A human should be able to draw on explicit artifact capabilities at many levels in the process hierarchy","title":"Engelbart Hlamt 1962"},{"location":"docs/digests/engelbart_hlamt_1962/#outline-for-doug-engelbarts-augmenting-human-intellect-a-conceptual-framework","text":"These notes are typed into an outline from paper notes taken while reading this paper.","title":"Outline for Doug Engelbart's \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework\""},{"location":"docs/digests/engelbart_hlamt_1962/#version-002","text":"","title":"Version: 0.02"},{"location":"docs/digests/engelbart_hlamt_1962/#future","text":"Try to get the notes structure to match the table of contents.

In 2012-2017, the FBI has repeatedly radicalized left-wing organizations to cross strict legal barriers in perceived assistance of domestic terrorism. If an agent knocks, federal investigators and your rights Today, the FBI may begin a full investigation whenever there is a reasonable indication that \"two or more persons are engaged in an enterprise for the purpose of furthering political or social goals wholly or in part through activities that involve force or violence and a violation of the criminal laws of the United States.\" The FBI has interpreted \"force or violence\" to include the destruction of property as a symbolic act, and the mere advocacy of such property destruction would trigger an investigation. Even without any reasonable indication, under a separate guideline on \"Civil Disorders and Demonstrations Involving a Federal Interest,\" the FBI may investigate an organization that plans only legal and peaceful demonstrations. Another set of rules governing federal intelligence gathering is Executive Order 12333, in force since 1981. It authorizes the FBI and CIA to infiltrate, manipulate and destroy U.S.political organizations, as well as to use electronic surveillance -- under the pretext of an international intelligence investigation. Here is a half baked guide about what infiltrators might do . Also in Texas, a left-wing group was infiltrated by an FBI informant who insisted that the group become violent in response to the Republican scourge. Once he convinced members to make Molotov cocktails, the FBI stormed in and made arrests . Lastly, the FBI infiltrated middle-aged peace activists and filed trumped-up charges of them providing \u201cassistance\u201d to terrorists. The bogus charges were eventually dropped. The FBI has also infiltrated Oil Pipeline Protestors using legal loopholes. Dictionary The book is dated in some political terminology. See the below list for clarifications. radical means activist in 2017 revolution means political revolution in 2017 Although, Alinsky doesn't make this strict distinction between whether violence is actually used. reformation means reorganization of values or priorities for your political base General Notes Wikipedia offers a summary of the rules : \u201cPower is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.\u201d Power is derived from 2 main sources \u2013 money and people. \u201cHave-Nots\u201d must build power from flesh and blood. \u201cNever go outside the expertise of your people.\u201d It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. \u201cWhenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.\u201d Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. \u201cMake the enemy live up to its own book of rules.\u201d If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. \u201cRidicule is man\u2019s most potent weapon.\u201d There is no defense. It\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. \u201cA good tactic is one your people enjoy.\u201d They\u2019ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They\u2019re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. \u201cA tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.\u201d Don\u2019t become old news. \u201cKeep the pressure on. Never let up.\u201d Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. \u201cThe threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.\u201d Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. \"The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.\" It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign. \u201cIf you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.\u201d Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. \u201cThe price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.\u201d Never let the enemy score points because you\u2019re caught without a solution to the problem. \u201cPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.\u201d Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. Rules for Radicals Notes Taken while reading the book. Prologue McCarthy Era \"Few [radicals] survived the Joe McCarthy Holocaust of the 1950s and of those there were even fewer whose understanding and insights had developed beyond the dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxism. My fellow radicals who were supposed to pass on the torch of experience and insights to the new generation just were not there. As the young looked around at society around them, it was all, in their words, 'materialistic, decadent, bourgeois in its values, bankrupt, and violent.' Is it any wonder that they rejected us in toto.\" (p. xiii) Reader note: McCarthyism is seen now as a reactionary backlash to issues as far ranging as women's suffrage , child labor laws , and gay rights , as well as a means for certain politicians to use fear to keep power. The FBI is also implicated heavily in performing illegal spying. There are loophopes for domestic spying used by the FBI today . Young vs. Old Young people have seen 'activist democracies' turn into 'nihilistic bombing and murder' and there is no panacea for it as there was in the past, 'revolution in Russia and China has since become the same old stuff under a different name'. Young people are looking for a way of life that has some meaning or sense: religion, political philosophy, science, or ideologies. The small world of the past inspired trust, and the big world of today inspires confusion and incomprehensibility. Generation Gap - Older people think younger people haven't learned how the world is, younger people think the old people will never get with the changing times. Approaches to the chaotic world by the young: Panic and run - \"copping out\" Hippies and Yuppies Taking drugs Trying communes Anything to escape Sure-loser confrontations: \"We tried and did our part\" Dying Jail Followed by panic and run, \"copping out\" Guilt and \"not knowing where to turn to\" Suicide Contempt \"take off for Algeria\" There are no rules for revolution as there are for revelation. There are no rules for revolution but there are rules for radicals . \"Remember we are talking about revolution, not revelation; you can miss the target by shooting too high as well as too low. First, there are no rules for revolution any more than there are rules for love or rules for happiness, but there are rules for radicals who want to change their world; there are central concepts of action in human politics that operate regardless of the scene or the time. To know these is basic to a pragmatic attack on the system. These rules make the difference between a realistic radical and being a rhetorical one who uses the tired old words and slogans, calls the police 'pig' or 'white fascist racist' or 'motherfucker' and has so stereotyped himself that others react by saying, 'oh, he's one of those ,' and then promptly turn off.\" (p. xviii) Communication Throughout history, silence has been regarded as assent -- in this case, assent to the system. If you cannot communicate in a way that your audience listens to you, you are silent no matter how loudly you scream. The inference here is that if you are not accepted in the community you wish to change, you are assenting to the system by not truly seeking a path to change that brings the community with you. Communicate within the experience of your audience Pay full respect to its values A fool attacks the American flag: it is the establishment which has betrayed the flag while the flag, itself, remains the glorious symbol of America's hopes and aspirations Humor and comedy are essential Through humor much is accepted that would be rejected if presented seriously. Note: People want to laugh and find joy in whatever they do. It inspires growth more than anything. Radicalism is social Do it for, and with, people If the real radical finds that having long hair sets up psychological barriers to communication and organization, he cuts his hair. Start your battle where the world is, not where you would like it to be. Work inside the system Dostoyevsky said that taking a new step is what people fear the most. Any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive, affirmative, non-challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people. They must feel so frustrated, so defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and chance the future. That acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution. To bring on this reformation requires that the organizer work inside the system, among not only the middle class but the 40 percent of American families... whose income ranges from $5000 to$10000 a year [in 1971 dollars]... IF we fail to communicate with them... they will move to the right... maybe they will anyways, but lets not let it happen by default. (p. xix) Non-Violence Violence is absurd when the other side has all the guns. Just one violent incident like has happened in the US would have resulted in a sweeping purge and mass executions in Russia, China, or Cuba. Lets keep some perspective. (paraphrased) Remember that we have the freedom to fight with our words and to build an opposition base against the administration. Start with the system There is no other place to start. Revolution is precededed by Reformation Also called popular reformation of your opposition political base People need a bridge to cross from their own experience to a new way Shake up the patterns of their lives Agitate Create Disenchantment Discontent with current values Goal: Produce a passive, affirmative, non-challenging climate or a passion for change in the political base . Revolution without prior reformation will collapse or become totalitarian tyranny. Reformation - People are fed up with past ways. They don't know what will work but they know that the present system is hopeless. They won't act for change but won't strongly oppose those who do. Then the time is ripe for revolution . Participation Citizen participation is the animating spirit and force in a society predicated on voluntarism. We are not here concerned with people who profess the democratic faith but yearn for the dark security of dependency where they can be spared the burden of decisions. To lose your \"identity\" as a citizen of democracy is but a step from losing your identity as a person. People react to this frustration by not acting at all. Hang on to one of the most precious parts of youth, laughter... (p. xxvii) Chapter 1 - The Purpose \"The Prince\" by Machiavelli is for the Haves on how to hold power. \"Rules for Radicals\" is for the Have Nots on how to take it away. Defining This Book Purpose: Create mass organizations to seize power and give it to the people. Premise: The significant changes in history have been made by revolutions. Content: The book proposes: Certain general observations propositions concepts of the mechanics of mass movements various stages of the cycle of action and reaction in a revolution This book will not contain any panacea or dogma; I detest and fear dogma. I know that all revolutions must have ideologies to spur them on. That in the heat of conflict these ideologies tend to be smelted into rigid dogmas claiming exclusive possession of the truth, and the keys to paradise, is tragic. Dogma is the enemy of human freedom. Dogma must be watched for and apprehended at every turn and twist of the revolutionary movement... To diminish the danger that ideology will deteriorate into dogma, and to protect the free, open, questing, and creative mind of man, as well as to allow for change, no ideology should be more specific than that of America's founding fathers: \"For the general welfare.\" (p. 4) Political Sensitivity & Control Over Events Resilient , Adaptable , and Sensitive \"Radicals must have a degree of control over the flow of events\" Have a plan for each branch in the path Adaptable: Merge the plan, old plans, similar experiences Adapt to shifting political circumstances Resilient: Don't back down!! Sensitive: find , create , and take opportunities Avoid being trapped by your own tactics Forced to travel a road not of your choosing. Keep the initiative. Do not pass the initiative. Keep things in motion!! Revolutionary \"how-to\" Guides Are Rare This text is dedicated to splitting two atomic ideas: revolution from communism Revolutionary literature is sparse! Literature extolling the virtues of the Haves is prolific Literature decrying revolution as reptilian, evil, and hellish is prolific To the status quo, revolution \"is the only force which has no image, but instead casts a dark, ominous shadow of things to come.\" A significant body of communist revolutionary literature exists It is embedded in the \"language of communism, red and yellow\" Tactics, maneuvers, strategy, and principles of action in the making of revolutions Today's situation is suicidal: revolution and communism have become one in peoples' minds We only accept revolution if it is guaranteed to be on our side and we can't find a way out Revolution is associated with communism \"The Status Quo\" is associated with capitalism Section: The Ideology of Change Question: What, if any, is my ideology? The prerequisite for ideology is possession of a basic truth Easy for christians, marxists Hard for an organizer working for open society, who must be a political relativist A free-society organizer is free of the shackles of dogma One belief: that people, given the power to act, will do the right thing in the long run, most of the time Politics of Change : free to focus on what matters to people now, rather than serve a dogma Note: This is perhaps better called the un-dogma of a free society. Political realists see the world as it is: an arena of power politics moved primarily by perceived immediate self-interests, where morality is rhetorical rationale for expedient action and self-interest. (p.12) Duality of Revolution and Counter-Revolution Accept and embrace the duality of revolution and counter-revolution . If you understand the big picture of revolution and counter-revolution then you can seek to alter the historical pattern of \"two steps forwards, one step back\". Examples of the duality of revolution and reaction (p. 16) Urban Housing Projects - A dream of replacing the tenements vs. a doubly segregated place. CIO + AF of L - CIO reforming AF of L becomes entrenched member of establishment as AFLCIO etc. Section: Class Distinctions: The Trinity Three Parts of Mankind Haves : want to keep power, money, food, security, luxury determined to freeze the Status Quo \"When do we sleep?\" - fear violent uprising Have-Nots : want to get poverty, rotten housing, disease, ignorance, political impotence, despair jobs pay the least deprived in all areas basic to human growth caged by color physical or political, barred from representation hate the establishment, opulence, police, courts, churches Justice, morality, law, and order are mere words when used by the Haves : justify and secure the status quo Power in Numbers. \"When do we eat?\", \"get off our backs\" Have-A-Little, Want Mores : the middle class Torn between status quo and change things to get more social, economic, political schizoids Generally seek the safe way Insist on three aces in their hand before playing the poker game of revolution Majority in the US, and generally in Western society. Argument by Alinksy that the greats come out of the middle class The middle class spawns people who provoke action but Do Nothing , \"I agree with your ends but not with your means.\" Act as a blanket for the sparks of disension. The book will examine both the Doers and the Do-Nothings . Edmund Burke: \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\" Alice in Wonderland : Tiger-Lily points out that the flowers that talk grow out of hard beds of ground. In most gardens, they make the beds too soft so that the flowers are always asleep. (p. 21) Change means movement. Movement means friction. Only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict. In these pages it is our open political purpose to cooperate with the great law of change; to want otherwise would be like King Canute's commanding the tides and waves to cease. Alinsky's personal philosophy is anchored in optimism. If we imagine the struggle as a mountain, we must visualize a mountain with no top.... Knowing that the mountain has no top... Why do we continue? ... because it's there... Different than Sisyphis, doomed to have the boulder roll back down again. We see new vistas at each plateau. The low road to morality. If you have bread and your neighbor has none, he will kill you and eat yours. We must accept that we rely on each other to continue a free society. You must share some of your wealth, or lose all of it. Remember: organizations are wealth, you can't destroy everyone. Note: Following this low road, welfare and basic income can be viewed, for better or for worse, as ransom on society's wealth. This is the low road to morality. There is no other.

Martin Multiple books, plus blog There are a rather large number of design principles 5 selected SOLID Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): \"Separation of Concerns\" Open-Closed Principle Liskov Substitution Principle Interface Segregation Principle Dependency Inversion Principle 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): \"Separation of Concerns\" Example: Journal class that also has persistence (save, load) Journal class stores and allows manipulating entries, but then also gets functionality for persistence. This is a bad idea for a number of reasons. Persistence would go in its own class. Instead write a PersistenceManager class with a static save_to_file(j, filename) method. Antipattern: 'God Object', everything into a single class. 2. Open-Closed Principle: \"Open for Extension, Closed for Modification.\" Example: Product has some properties, size, color. How do you filter product by color? Use a for loop to filter by color. But now we want to filter by size. When you add new functionality, add by extension, not modification. Now try filter by color and size... you add a third function for color AND size. This approach is combinatorial. You are also causing a state-space explosion . Add weight and for 3 params you need summation(3) filters: 3+2+1 Lets add the new filters through modification and use an \"enterprise pattern\". \"Enterprise patterns require a separate course.\" Enterprise Pattern: \"Specification\" class Product : def __init__ ( self , name , color , size ) : self . name = name self . color = color self . size = size # OCP = open for extension, closed for modification # see the course resources for the full implementation with some testing class Specification : ' '' determine if an item specifies a criteria This is a base class. You are intended to override the methods.

Liskov Substitution Principle Named after Barbara Liskov. If you have an interface named after a base class you should be able to stick a derived class in and everything should work. Imagine a Rectangle class and a Square class that inherits from rectangle. Square should work wherever rectangle worked. So maybe we expect width*height=area , where class rectangle has each @property : width, height. so for square, lets just take one dimension, size , since width is height. Now if we set width and height at the same time, both from size , \"this looks very innocent\" now if we use use_it , it only works on a rectangle, because it sets width, height explicitly. We can fix use_it a few ways: don't have a square class (doesn't solve use_it), don't allow the setters trent: avoid square class is the right answer, we should still use @property in Python. trent: so this means that our descendants are constrained by our downstream implementations? i don't love this... So uh... When we need to refactor, we need to enumerate downstream impelementation before we can subclass something? Well, alright... 4. Interface Segregation Principle If you have a \"kitchen sink interface\", then individual implementations have a bunch of NOOP methods. If someone makes an instance of a limited implementation, they try using the NOOP methods. 5.

TODOs There are a few in the document. Important TODO: \"Maintaining a Library of Chunks Topics What is a chunk? How to form a chunk? Pitfalls Extending the analogy A \"Library of Chunks\" Additional context What is a chunk? Human brains have 4 slots of working memory, you can think of your reasoning as 4 armed octopus able to touch only 4 remembered items at a time. A chunk is a collection of memories that form a concept. For example, the snick of a pop bottle opening connects to the word \"pop\" and the letters \"p\" \"o\" \"p\". One is a qualia, the other is a logical construction through written phoenetic glyphs. You can also sketch a can of pop as a visual qualia for this chunk. A chunk can be very large or small. The course says a chunk is like compression but this anaology is flawed, because a chunk itself is more like a nexus of memories and reasonings. A chunk is like a summary with hyperlinks to related chunks that might be larger or smaller in size or relationship. A chunk might be tightly related to some chunks and loosely related to other chunks. \"Conceptual chunk\": Mental leap that unites scattered bits through memory. Trent: There is a concept of scattered bits of memory that are not worth detailing as their own chunk in your context of study. It may or may not be useful to focus in on any of these scattered bits as chunks themselves. For example, in the \"pop\" chunk, the letter \"p\" is a scattered bit, but it has its own chunk with a lot of context, like the vocalization of the letter, it's various forms, \"P\", 'p\", its history through the history of language. But, you probably do not wish to develop that chunk when focusing on a different topic, e.g. the topic at hand, \"learning what a chunk is\". Every discipline is a little different for memories. Imagine: walking, doing a math problem, and telling a story. Synthesizing a collection of chunks and creatively integrating two different chunks in a new context are related to the idea of \"expertise\". Transfer : A chunk in one discipline might share commonalities with a chunk in a different discipline. Trent's Thought Experiment about connecting unrelated chunks This is kind of like mad libs . Thought experiment: How are my grandmother's favorite shoes related to household accounting practices? I know my grandmother is good at accounting, and this starts to fire a lot of memories about how she learned these skills since she did not have much education. This road of obtuse reasoning is long. Thought experiments about unrelated chunks can yield interesting connections. Expertise and Creative Integration Expertise is chunking and performing creative interpretations as you gain fluency. How to form a chunk? Perform these steps when practicing or studying material. 1. \"Undivided Attention\" Turn off all notifications Any single interruption \"uproots\" some neural connections being made (weaker foundation) 2. \"Understand\" Get the \"main idea\" or \"gist\": \"top down learning\" \"Superglue\" the pieces together \"Broad traces\" and \"link to other traces you have\" Finding links to other knowledge will stimulate dopamine reward Do a picture walk through a chapter before reading it 3. \"Gain Context\" - \"deliberate practice\", \"recall\", \"review\", \"when to use the chunk\" Perform: \"deliberate practice\": Process: work on primarily difficult problems TODO: How do we identify \"difficult problems\" in each of the below contexts? problem sets (math, sciences, computer science, etc.) practical experience (medicine, carpentry) physical techniques (judo, dancing) songs foreign language conversations ... (what else?) Perform: \"recall\" Process: Remember everything you can with only your brain: simply use your mind, or use a blank docoument Review your notes against the material, identifying gaps Mediums: Mind: Simply recall what you can, then recall what you can about each item Not easy to validate against the notes later, maybe has other benefits? Physical: Outline, Diagrams, Notes, Sketches, Paragraphs (paper or digital) Easy to validate your progress/success Can create a more organized permanent reference Recall in a different place to decouple your access to a chunk from where you learned it Generation Effect : \"The generation effect is a phenomenon where information is better remembered if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply read\" On the first recall, you will prime the generation effect, creating \"neural hooks\" On the second recall, you will take advantage of the generation effect. Wikipedia: Generation Effect Trent: probably can do this 1x before needing to dip back into \"diffuse mode\" (workout, sleep, socialize) Perform: \"review\" Perform more \"deliberate practice\" and \"recall\" with previous related chunks. New relationships with the old material and the new material will be stronger Review the material both \"forwards\" and \"backwards\" Learn WHEN to use the \"chunk\" Analogy: when to use a hammer vs a mallet \"Do a picture walk through a chapter before reading it\" Know how the \"pieces of the puzzle\" fit together (knowledge inside the chunk) 4. \"Repair the Flaws\" Process: Identify your misunderstandings and repeat \"deliberate proactice\" with the right ideas This is part of the same study methods above It's important enough here to call out as a step 5. \"Interleaving during Practice\" Mix up your learning within a subject or even between multiple subjects Find other contexts that have this chunk or a similar chunk In a textbook, read through nearby problem sets to find other applications that contain the problem Trent: Time intensive? How to get a library of interleaved problems quickly? Example: Learning a guitar song I like this analogy because it is easy to \"test\" if the song sounds right. \"Understand\" Listen to the song \"Practice\" Grasp bits of the song Review chords and notes and be able to play them Join passages until you know all the parts Try the whole song keep improving Pitfalls Working memory doesn't work as well under stressors: low sleep, stress, sickness, etc. Rereading material once you have context Instead use \"recall\" then compare the material to your recall results Research supports that this is a comparatively better method for learning Compared to some other methods: concept maps, notes, rereading Probably still want to take notes, that's done during studying and can be used for recall comparison Overlearning Repeating problems you already learned Usually a waste of time, instead try to \"cover a lot of ground\" Instead: Once you get more context with more chunks, then repeat your old problems It is useful if you need \"the perfect tennis serve\" Can be used positively to combat \"text anxiety\" but will cost time (tradeoff) Overtraining for perfect public speaking: \"A 20 minute TED Talk can take 70 hours of practice\" Einstellung Stuck in a way of \"focused mode\" thinking you already have Try taking a break, go into \"diffuse mode\" and reapproach the problem fresh later A \"Library of Chunks\" To develop expertise in a discipline, build two things: \"a bigger chunk library\" \"a more well-practiced chunk library\". Extending the analogy Consider a chunk as a ribbon of learning. The ribbon will grow wider and longer as you improve at making chunks. You might listen to the \"whispers of the diffuse mode\" that will forge a new connection between two distance places on the ribbon. Problem: Too much ground to cover! There are so many chunks in a discipline, how will you get to them all? \"Law of Serendipity\": Lady luck favors the one who tries. Solution: As you form a chunk, nearby chunks will be easier to form. A bigger \"library of chunks\" will naturally grow. But you must practice each chunk to make it \"wider\" which will make later practice cover more ground. Later practice will not get easier, but it will cover more ground at the same difficulty. Practicing related chunks will help you begin to classify \"types of chunks\" and \"classes of concepts\". I think these are probably also considred chunks. If you are well studied, you are probably already familiar with a library of \"types of problems\". TODO: Maintaining your \"Library of Chunks\" How can I stay in practice? I might have a group of chunks that I want to have front-of-mind. One shortcut would be to carefully maintain the library of problems I used to develop that chunk and periodically repeat solving those problems. Other parts of the founding material of chunks: primary readings, primary practices, related problems, related readings. How would a graph representation work for managing the inputs to developing a group of related chunks representing a discipline? Additional context \"Sequential Reasoning\" are focused mode reasonings \"Holistic Intution\" are diffuse mode ideas You MUST carefully verify \"holistic intuition\" with \"sequential reasoning\" Trent: Even modern physics has 2 incompatible models, I have enocuntered many people that try to use deductive logic on their mental models. Mental models are generally not sufficient to form a closed system. Deductive reasoning needs to be backed up with inductive facts if possible, otherwise it is generally too leaky and insufficient, especially in highly technical black box systems.

Focused Mode of Thinking Focusing: concentrate intently on what you are trying to understand Diffuse Mode of Thinking Relaxed: related to a set of neural resting states Metaphor and analogy are very helpful when learning something new. Analogy: Pinball Game Think of the brain as an array of pinball bumpers. The focused mode has mamy, tightly packed bumpers. The diffuse mode has fewer, broadly spaced bumpers. The path of a ball between a number of bumpers is a familiar way of thinking. If you haven't thought a thought before, how will you know the path of the ball? How will you get the ball to the new thought pattern? As far as neural scientists know right now, you are either in focused or diffuse mode of thinking. You can see one side of the coin, or the other, but not both at the same time. Being in one mode limits your access to the other mode of thinking. Video 2: Introduction to the Course Structure Goal: Reframe how you think about learning. The course is especially useful for learning math and science. Experts from many professions who give tips about learning. You will see how you can fool yourself about whether you actually know the material. Discover new ways to hold your focus and embed the material more deeply and powerfully in your mind. Condense key ideas you are learning about so you can grasp them more easily. Master the simple approaches outlined here, including simple tips to help prevent procrastination, and you'll be able to learn more effectively and with less frustration. Video 3: sing the Focused and Diffuse Modes--Or, a Little Dali will do You Your mind needs to go back and forth between the two learning modes, that's what makes you learn effectively. Analogy: Lifting weights. You can't work out like a fiend the day before a weightlifting competition. Neural structure is like a muscle, gradually grow a neural scaffold to hang your thinking on. Learning something difficult takes time. Salvador Dali - the very definition of \"a wild and crazy guy\" Thomas Edison - One of the most brilliant inventors ever Dali's technique Relax in a chair and let his mind go free. Dangle a key in his hand just above the floor. And just as he drifted into his dreams, falling asleep he would drop the key, waking himself up. Just in time to gather the diffuse mode connections and ideas in his mind And back he would go into the focused mode , bringing with him the new connections he made in the diffuse mode Edison Technique According to legend... Relax in his chair, holding ball-bearings in his hand His mind would run free and noodle back in a relaxed way to what he would focus on The ball bearings drop and clatter to the ground - same as Dali He is awakened! Off he would go with his ideas in the diffuse mode , ready to build on them in the focused mode Week 1: What is Learning? Some Context Brain weighs 3 lbs. Consumes 10x more energy by weight than rest of body. Most complex device in the known universe. We are not consciously aware of how our brains work. Brains evolved to help us navigate complex environments. Most of heavy lifting is below consciousness. Surprised to find out that running , reaching , seeing , hearing are much more complex problems than we thought (than chess and math ) and still out of the reach of raw computer processing. Much of heavy lifting below the level of consciousness and we don't need to know how it's done to survive We are only aware of a tiny fraction of events in the mind There are areas of the brain that are active during focused states, and other areas of the brain that are active during resting states. Brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures. New synapses form and others disappear. How do memories remain stable over so many years? Viewing a dendritic branch on a neuron. After learning and sleep the dendrite has new synapses. Synapses < 1 micron diameter; human hair is 20 microns diameter. Near the limit of light microscopy. You are not the same person you were after a nap or night sleep. Upgrade! Shakespeare: Macbeth laments insomnia, sleep knits up your experiences into the tapestry of your life story.

You can verify the work product of your reading. The work product is that you learned the material. Another major plug for flashcards and spaced repetition. Maybe I should just keep a paper system of mixed flashcards that I can rebase as neeed. Electronic ones are not working. Use outside resources early and often. Identify helpful people and don't waste your time on people that aren't successful at teaching you. Airplane Mode: Every text message pulls up the roots of your attempt to learn. Sleep is the foundation of learning and survival. 10 Rules of Studying These rules form a synthesis of some of the main ideas of the course--they are excerpted from the book A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel in Math and Science (Even if You Flunked Algebra), by Barbara Oakley, Penguin, July, 2014. Feel free to copy these rules and redistribute them, as long as you keep the original wording and this citation. 10 Rules of Good Studying Use recall. After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas. Highlight very little, and never highlight anything you haven\u2019t put in your mind first by recalling. Try recalling main ideas when you are walking to class or in a different room from where you originally learned it. An ability to recall\u2014to generate the ideas from inside yourself\u2014is one of the key indicators of good learning. Test yourself. On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend. Chunk your problems. Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it cold\u2014every step. Pretend it\u2019s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind, so the information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want. Space your repetition. Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day, just like an athlete. Your brain is like a muscle\u2014it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time. Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice. Never practice too long at any one session using only one problem-solving technique\u2014after a while, you are just mimicking what you did on the previous problem. Mix it up and work on different types of problems. This teaches you both how and when to use a technique. (Books generally are not set up this way, so you\u2019ll need to do this on your own.) After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make sure you understand why you made them, and then rework your solutions. To study most effectively, handwrite (don\u2019t type) a problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the other. (Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing.) You might also photograph the card if you want to load it into a study app on your smartphone. Quiz yourself randomly on different types of problems. Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your book, pick out a problem, and see whether you can solve it cold. Take breaks. It is common to be unable to solve problems or figure out concepts in math or science the first time you encounter them. This is why a little study every day is much better than a lot of studying all at once. When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that another part of your mind can take over and work in the background. Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies. Whenever you are struggling with a concept, think to yourself, How can I explain this so that a ten-year-old could understand it? Using an analogy really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water. Don\u2019t just think your explanation\u2014say it out loud or put it in writing. The additional effort of speaking and writing allows you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are learning. Focus. Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a timer for twenty-five minutes. Focus intently for those twenty-five minutes and try to work as diligently as you can. After the timer goes off, give yourself a small, fun reward. A few of these sessions in a day can really move your studies forward. Try to set up times and places where studying\u2014not glancing at your computer or phone\u2014is just something you naturally do. Eat your frogs first. Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh. Make a mental contrast. Imagine where you\u2019ve come from and contrast that with the dream of where your studies will take you. Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your dream. Look at that when you find your motivation lagging. This work will pay off both for you and those you love! 10 Rules of Bad Studying Excerpted from A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel in Math and Science (Even if You Flunked Algebra), by Barbara Oakley, Penguin, July, 2014 Avoid these techniques\u2014they can waste your time even while they fool you into thinking you\u2019re learning! Passive rereading \u2014sitting passively and running your eyes back over a page. Unless you can prove that the material is moving into your brain by recalling the main ideas without looking at the page, rereading is a waste of time. Letting highlights overwhelm you. Highlighting your text can fool your mind into thinking you are putting something in your brain, when all you\u2019re really doing is moving your hand. A little highlighting here and there is okay\u2014sometimes it can be helpful in flagging important points. But if you are using highlighting as a memory tool, make sure that what you mark is also going into your brain. Merely glancing at a problem\u2019s solution and thinking you know how to do it. This is one of the worst errors students make while studying. You need to be able to solve a problem step-by-step, without looking at the solution. Waiting until the last minute to study. Would you cram at the last minute if you were practicing for a track meet? Your brain is like a muscle\u2014it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time. Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know how to solve. If you just sit around solving similar problems during your practice, you\u2019re not actually preparing for a test\u2014it\u2019s like preparing for a big basketball game by just practicing your dribbling. Letting study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions. Checking your problem solving with friends, and quizzing one another on what you know, can make learning more enjoyable, expose flaws in your thinking, and deepen your learning. But if your joint study sessions turn to fun before the work is done, you\u2019re wasting your time and should find another study group. Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems. Would you dive into a pool before you knew how to swim? The textbook is your swimming instructor\u2014it guides you toward the answers. You will flounder and waste your time if you don\u2019t bother to read it. Before you begin to read, however, take a quick glance over the chapter or section to get a sense of what it\u2019s about. Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of confusion. Professors are used to lost students coming in for guidance\u2014it\u2019s our job to help you. The students we worry about are the ones who don\u2019t come in. Don\u2019t be one of those students. Thinking you can learn deeply when you are being constantly distracted. Every tiny pull toward an instant message or conversation means you have less brain power to devote to learning. Every tug of interrupted attention pulls out tiny neural roots before they can grow. Not getting enough sleep. Your brain pieces together problem-solving techniques when you sleep, and it also practices and repeats whatever you put in mind before you go to sleep. Prolonged fatigue allows toxins to build up in the brain that disrupt the neural connections you need to think quickly and well. If you don\u2019t get a good sleep before a test, NOTHING ELSE YOU HAVE DONE WILL MATTER.","title":"Old Reviseme Learning How To Learn Coursera"},{"location":"docs/digests/learning-how-to-learn/old-reviseme-learning-how-to-learn-coursera/#learning-how-to-learn","text":"Learn the basics of how the brain works to learn more easily and be less frustrated.

I am hoping to set this up. Do you know where I can find a checklist or aggregation of modern guide about specific implementations? I know a lot of the tech involved but not the specific products. Mostly, I recommend channeling everything through GnuPG and running hardware for that. You'll have issues if you try to simultaneously use something like PKCS#11 for your SSH agent but GnuPG for other tasks. I document using GnuPG for SSH in my desktop config repo , including hardware. There are guides to creating an offline, software-managed root key and then signing the hardware tokens with that, but I prefer to just manage a set of hardware tokens instead. The hierarchical approaches only solve direct GnuPG usage, anyway, not SSH. My secrets include gpg keys, ssh keys, possibly a keepassx key depending on how I decide to do that. I need to check that. Right now I memorize more passwords than is probably advisable. You can centralize all three needs (and more) on GnuPG with a hardware token: GnuPG keys will obviously work as expected when backed with compatible hardware (instead of just software). My repo above explains basic setup from initializing hardware tokens to setting up new machines/installations to use existing tokens. You'll want to move your SSH client to using the agent provided by GnuPG. This will require you to upload SSH public keys generated from your GnuPG keys. My repo above explains the rest, including auto-starting the GnuPG agent. For passwords, I use Password Store . This supports encrypting/decrypting with GnuPG and synchronizing repositories over git, which you can do using git+ssh to leverage the previous work. For mobile password access, NFC-compatible GnuPG tokens (and USB if you're willing to use a dongle) can decrypt entries in hardware on Android devices. For Android's git+ssh access, I just use an SSH key resident on my phone. Hardware tokens aren't yet supported for SSH on Android, but Password Store doesn't depend on repository access for password security, anyway. For Google, GitHub, and Dropbox (and other U2F-supporting services), I use a YubiKey (which can also provide a combination of GnuPG hardware and NFC, depending on model). So, in short, I can nearly run my whole crypto stack in hardware with one YubiKey Neo or any U2F key plus a Sigilance card (my laptop has a smart card reader). The only thing I don't have working yet is backing my browser client certificates with a GnuPG agent.","title":"David Recommendations Keystorage"},{"location":"docs/external/sat-for-noobs/","text":"The SAT problem for noobs Originally posted at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crillab/gophersat/master/examples/sat-for-noobs.md This document gives an overview of the SAT problem, and how to use a SAT solver to solve a given problem. It is intended for users of such solvers. It does not describe strategies, algorithms or implementation of such solvers. The intended audience for this document are developpers, so it assumes the reader understands boolean logic. This document is work in progress. Expect it to be improved over time. What is the SAT problem? SAT is a shortcut for \"boolean satisfiability\". Imagine you have a boolean formula , i.e a formula containing boolean variables . For instance: (a and (b or not(c))) or (not(b) and c) In this formula, a , b and c can either be true or false. The SAT problem is the problem of finding an assignment for these variables so that the whole formula becomes true, if such an assignment exists. This assignment is called a model , and a formula can have zero, one or several models. In the above problem, a=false, b=true, c=false is not a model of the formula, because (false and (true or not(false))) or (not(true) and false) reduces to false . However, the assignment a=true, b=true, c=false is a model, because (true and (true or not(false))) or (not(true) and false) reduces to true . Now, the trivial problem a and not(a) has no model, because there is no way to make this formula true, no matter the value associated with a . This formula is said to be unsatisfiable (UNSAT for short). What is a SAT solver? A SAT solver is a piece of software that, when given a formula (more on the input syntax below), returns either one model, if at least one model exists, or the indication that the problem is unsatisfiable . Implementing such a piece of software is rather easy, but there's one little problem: the SAT problem is NP-complete, meaning all known algorithms to solve it take an exponential time (worse-case complexity is O(k^n) , with k > 1 ), and we're not even sure there is a way to make a non-exponential algorithm (this is the famous \"P = NP\" problem). So, the most trivial algorithm to solve the SAT problem (test all possible assignments for all variables, stop when one makes the formula true, return UNSAT once all assignments were unsuccessful), has a worse-case complexity of O(2^n) . That means there are, for instance, more than 1 billion assignments to test for a formula with 30 variables, and about 1.27 * 10^30 for a formula with 100 variables: the time to solve a very simple problem is unacceptable. But all hope is not lost. The first good news is that exponential does not necessarily mean 2^n . It means k^n , with k > 1 . Solving the SAT problem is a whole research field, and algorithms are more and more efficient, trying to bring k as close to 1 as possible. Because, for instance, although an algorithm with a worst-case complexity of O(1.01^n) is still exponential, there are only about 400 million operations to solve a problem with 2000 variables. The second good news is that practical, real-world, industrial problems are generally structured in such a way that worst-case complexity is just a theoretical limit. Those problems are usually easier to solve than theoretical ones. The third good news is that, according to the Cook-Levin theorem, any NP-complete problem can be translated in a SAT problem, meaning all the research effort in emproving the efficiency of SAT solvers also profits all other NP-complete problems. In other words, when you are facing an NP-complete problem, you can either try to develop a specific algorithm to solve it, use a dedicated piece of software (if such a software exists) or try to translate it to SAT and use a SAT solver. What is the input format of a SAT solver? How do I represent my problem? Conjunctive Normal Form To be solved by a SAT solver, a problem must be described in CNF , or Conjunctive Normal Form. The CNF is a conjunction of disjunctions. In other words, a CNF formula is a set of clauses , all of which must be true: F = C1 and C2 and C3 and ... and Cn A clause is a set of literals, of which one (at least) must be true: Ci = L1 or L2 or ... or Lm A literal is a variable, potentially negated. Any boolean formula can be translated to an equivalent CNF formula in polynomial time, although the process can sometimes be tricky. For instance, the formula (a and (b or not(c))) or (not(b) and c) is equivalent to the following CNF formula (x1 or x2) and (not(x1) or a) and (not(x1) or b or not(c)) and (not(x2) or not(b)) and (not(x2) or c) Note that a few more variables had to be introduced. DIMACS format the standard way of describing a CNF formula is through the DIMACS syntax. A DIMACS file consists in a one-line prolog, and the description of each clause on each following lines. The prolog starts with p cnf and is followed by the number of variables and the number of clauses: p cnf 5 5 Then, on each line, a clause is described. A clause is described as a list of integer values separated by spaces, and ending with th value 0. That means each variable must be translated as an integer value. Negation is represented by the minus sign. For instance, let's say a is 1, b is 2, c is 3, x1 is 4, x2 is 5. The clause not(x2) or c will be translated as -5 3 0 . The above formula will then be written as: p cnf 5 5 4 5 0 -4 1 0 -4 2 -3 0 -5 -2 0 -5 3 0 The SAT solver, when given an input, will then return either the string UNSATISFIABLE or the string SATISFIABLE with an assignment that makes the formula true. For instance, when fed the formula above, Gophersat will answer: SATISFIABLE -1 -2 3 -4 5 It means that, when both c and x2 are true, and all other variables are false, the whole formula becomes true. Since x1 and x2 were dummy variables we introduced to make our original formula a CNF, we can say that our original formula is true when a=false, b=false, c=true . Remember this is not necessarily the only model for this formula, but finding all models (or getting the total number of models) would take a longer time and is not always useful. Translating a general boolean formula to a CNF formula Formulas need to be in CNF to be used by a SAT solver. However, problems are usually not formulated this way. Translating general boolean formulas to CNF is thus required. This process can be automated, but for the moment Gophersat doesn't include such a translator. Here are a few guidelines to translate general formulas to CNF. Negation In a CNF formula, negation only applies to literals, not to subformulas. Using DeMorgan's laws, such a transformation is trivial: not(F1 or F2) (where F1 and F2 are subformulas) becomes not(F1) and not(F2) and not(F1 and F2) becomes not(F1) or not(F2) . Such transformations are then applied recursively, until only literals are negated. Implication (if... then) Implication is easily translated in CNF: a -> b is equivalent to not(a) or b . Equivalence (equality) The formula a <-> b is equivalent to (a -> b) and (b -> a) , and can thus be translated as the set of clauses (not(a) or b) and (not(b) or a) . Exclusive or The formula a xor b is equivalent to a <-> not(b) , so it can be written (a or b) and (not(a) or not(b)) . From disjunction of conjunctions to conjunctions of disjunctions In a CNF formula, literals are linked by or operators to form clauses, and clauses are linked by and operators. How do you deal with the opposite, i.e a subformula like (F1 and F2) or (F3 and F4) where F1 , F2 , F3 and F4 are subformulas? There are several ways, but the most efficient one requires the introduction of new variables: let's rewrite this formula as ( x1 <-> ( F1 and F2 )) and ( x2 <-> ( F3 and F4 )) and ( x1 or x2 ) According to the rules above, x1 <-> (F1 and F2) can be rewritten as (not(x1) or F1) and (not(x1) or F2) and (not(F1) or not(F2) or x1) So, the original formula can be written as the following set of clauses: not(x1) or F1 not(x1) or F2 x1 or not(F1) or not(F2) not(x2) or F3 not(x2) or F4 x2 or not(F3) or not(F4) x1 or x2 By applying this rule (and all rules above) recursively, you can translate any boolean formula in a CNF equivalent. Uniqueness Very often, one wants to specify that exactly one boolean variable among several must be true, the others being false. For instance, you may want to state that a device is in one of four states : s1, s2, s3 or s4. It can be written as this set of clauses : s1 or s2 or s3 or s4 not(s1) or not(s2) not(s1) or not(s3) not(s1) or not(s4) not(s2) or not(s3) not(s2) or not(s4) not(s3) or not(s4) The first clause states \"at least one state is true\". Then, for each pair of states, one clause states that at least one of these two states is false. Note that it can lead to the generation of a lot of clauses: there are n*(n-1)/2 pairs of variables. So, when n is big, a huge amount of clauses can be generated. There are other, more efficient encodings, but they are a little more complicated and won't be explained in this document. Examples In this section, you will find the translation of a few problems translated as a boolean formula, then as a CNF boolean formula, then as a DIMACS file format. Sudoku Let's say we want to solve a sudoku problem. Such a problem has a set of constraints: each spot has exactly one number from 1 to 9, on each line, each number appears exctaly once, on each column, each number appears exactly once, in each 3x3 box, each number appears exactly once, a few spots are already assigned numbers. We must translate this problem in a formalism using only boolean variables, i.e assertions that are either true or false. In this problem, the variables we will use will be: line-1-col-1-is-a-1 line-1-col-1-is-a-2 ... line-1-col-1-is-a-9 line-1-col-2-is-a-1 ... and so on. So, we will have 9*9*9=729 variables to represent this problem, each one indicating line-x-col-y-is-a-z , or, as a shortcut, x;y=z , so we will have 1;1=1 , 1;1=2 and so on. Now, we must represent all our contraints. Each spot has exactly one number For each spot, we must indicate that the associated value is unique: unique(1;1=1, 1;1=2, 1;1=3, 1;1=4, 1;1=5, 1;1=6, 1;1=7, 1;1=8, 1;1=9) and unique(1;2=1, 1;2=2, 1;2=3, 1;2=4, 1;2=5, 1;2=6, 1;2=7, 1;2=8, 1;2=9) and ... and unique(9;9=1, 9;9=2, 9;9=3, 9;9=4, 9;9=5, 9;9=6, 9;9=7, 9;9=8, 9;9=9) This can be translated as a CNF set of clauses (see transformation rules above): 1 ; 1 = 1 or 1 ; 1 = 2 or 1 ; 1 = 3 or 1 ; 1 = 4 or 1 ; 1 = 5 or 1 ; 1 = 6 or 1 ; 1 = 7 or 1 ; 1 = 8 or 1 ; 1 = 9 not ( 1 ; 1 = 1 ) or not ( 1 ; 1 = 2 ) not ( 1 ; 1 = 1 ) or not ( 1 ; 1 = 3 ) not ( 1 ; 1 = 1 ) or not ( 1 ; 1 = 4 ) ... not ( 1 ; 1 = 8 ) or not ( 1 ; 1 = 9 ) This will lead to the generation of 1 + (9*8)/2 = 37 clauses for each spot, i.e 9*9*37 = 2997 clauses for all spots. Each line, column, box contains each number Since there are 9 spots in a line and each number from 1 to 9 must appear once, stating that each number must appear at least once is enough. So, we will write: (1;1=1 or 1;2=1 or 1;3=1 or 1;4=1 or 1;5=1 or 1;6=1 or 1;7=1 or 1;8=1 or 1;9=1) and (2;1=1 or 2;2=1 or 2;3=1 or 2;4=1 or 2;5=1 or 2;6=1 or 2;7=1 or 2;8=1 or 2;9=1) and ... and (9;1=1 or 9;2=1 or 9;3=1 or 9;4=1 or 9;5=1 or 9;6=1 or 9;7=1 or 9;8=1 or 9;9=1) and (1;1=2 or 1;2=2 or 1;3=2 or 1;4=2 or 1;5=2 or 1;6=2 or 1;7=2 or 1;8=2 or 1;9=2) and ... This will lead to the generation of 9*9=81 clauses. The same reasoning can be applied for columns and boxes, leading to the generation of 81 clauses each time. Already assigned numbers Now this is easy, we just have to state that a few variables are known to be true. So, for the following problem: the following clauses will be added: 1 ; 1 = 5 1 ; 2 = 3 1 ; 5 = 7 2 ; 1 = 6 2 ; 4 = 1 2 ; 5 = 9 2 ; 6 = 5 .... This will lead to the generation of one clause per already assigned number, i.e 30 clauses for the example problem above. Putting it all together in a DIMACS file To generate the corresponding DIMACS file, we must indicate the total number of variables and clauses in the prolog line. There are 729 variables and 2997+81+81+81+30=3270 clauses, so the prolog will be p cnf 729 3270 Now, each variable must be associated with a numeric value, from 1 to 729. Let's say that x;y=z is translated as (x-1) * 81 + (y-1) * 9 + z . So, 1;1=1 will be 1 and 9;9=9 will be 729. The complete DIMACS file is available. When fed that problem, gophersat will answer SATISFIABLE -1 -2 -3 -4 5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 -11 12 -13 -14 -15 -16 -17 -18 -19 -20 -21 22 -23 -24 -25 -26 -27 -28 -29 -30 -31 -32 33 -34 -35 -36 -37 -38 -39 -40 -41 -42 43 -44 -45 -46 -47 -48 -49 -50 -51 -52 53 -54 -55 -56 -57 -58 -59 -60 -61 -62 63 64 -65 -66 -67 -68 -69 -70 -71 -72 -73 74 -75 -76 -77 -78 -79 -80 -81 -82 -83 -84 -85 -86 87 -88 -89 -90 -91 -92 -93 -94 -95 -96 97 -98 -99 -100 101 -102 -103 -104 -105 -106 -107 -108 109 -110 -111 -112 -113 -114 -115 -116 -117 -118 -119 -120 -121 -122 -123 -124 -125 126 -127 -128 -129 -130 131 -132 -133 -134 -135 -136 -137 138 -139 -140 -141 -142 -143 -144 -145 -146 -147 148 -149 -150 -151 -152 -153 -154 -155 -156 -157 -158 -159 -160 161 -162 163 -164 -165 -166 -167 -168 -169 -170 -171 -172 -173 -174 -175 -176 -177 -178 -179 180 -181 -182 -183 -184 -185 -186 -187 188 -189 -190 -191 192 -193 -194 -195 -196 -197 -198 -199 -200 -201 202 -203 -204 -205 -206 -207 -208 209 -210 -211 -212 -213 -214 -215 -216 -217 -218 -219 -220 221 -222 -223 -224 -225 -226 -227 -228 -229 -230 231 -232 -233 -234 -235 -236 -237 -238 -239 -240 241 -242 -243 -244 -245 -246 -247 -248 -249 -250 251 -252 -253 -254 -255 -256 257 -258 -259 -260 -261 -262 -263 -264 -265 -266 -267 -268 -269 270 -271 -272 -273 -274 -275 -276 277 -278 -279 -280 -281 -282 -283 -284 285 -286 -287 -288 289 -290 -291 -292 -293 -294 -295 -296 -297 -298 -299 -300 301 -302 -303 -304 -305 -306 -307 308 -309 -310 -311 -312 -313 -314 -315 -316 -317 318 -319 -320 -321 -322 -323 -324 -325 -326 -327 328 -329 -330 -331 -332 -333 -334 335 -336 -337 -338 -339 -340 -341 -342 -343 -344 -345 -346 -347 348 -349 -350 -351 -352 -353 -354 -355 -356 -357 -358 359 -360 -361 -362 -363 -364 365 -366 -367 -368 -369 -370 -371 372 -373 -374 -375 -376 -377 -378 -379 -380 -381 -382 -383 -384 385 -386 -387 -388 -389 -390 -391 -392 -393 -394 -395 396 397 -398 -399 -400 -401 -402 -403 -404 -405 -406 -407 -408 -409 -410 -411 412 -413 -414 415 -416 -417 -418 -419 -420 -421 -422 -423 -424 -425 426 -427 -428 -429 -430 -431 -432 -433 -434 -435 -436 -437 -438 -439 -440 441 -442 443 -444 -445 -446 -447 -448 -449 -450 -451 -452 -453 454 -455 -456 -457 -458 -459 -460 -461 -462 -463 -464 -465 -466 467 -468 -469 -470 -471 -472 473 -474 -475 -476 -477 -478 -479 -480 -481 -482 483 -484 -485 -486 -487 -488 -489 -490 -491 -492 -493 -494 495 -496 -497 -498 -499 -500 501 -502 -503 -504 505 -506 -507 -508 -509 -510 -511 -512 -513 -514 -515 -516 -517 518 -519 -520 -521 -522 -523 -524 525 -526 -527 -528 -529 -530 -531 -532 -533 -534 -535 -536 -537 538 -539 -540 -541 542 -543 -544 -545 -546 -547 -548 -549 -550 -551 -552 -553 -554 -555 -556 557 -558 -559 -560 -561 562 -563 -564 -565 -566 -567 -568 569 -570 -571 -572 -573 -574 -575 -576 -577 -578 -579 -580 -581 -582 -583 584 -585 -586 -587 -588 -589 -590 -591 592 -593 -594 -595 -596 -597 598 -599 -600 -601 -602 -603 604 -605 -606 -607 -608 -609 -610 -611 -612 -613 -614 -615 -616 -617 -618 -619 -620 621 -622 -623 -624 -625 -626 627 -628 -629 -630 -631 -632 633 -634 -635 -636 -637 -638 -639 -640 -641 -642 -643 644 -645 -646 -647 -648 -649 -650 651 -652 -653 -654 -655 -656 -657 -658 -659 -660 661 -662 -663 -664 -665 -666 -667 -668 -669 -670 671 -672 -673 -674 -675 -676 677 -678 -679 -680 -681 -682 -683 -684 -685 -686 -687 -688 -689 -690 -691 692 -693 -694 -695 -696 -697 -698 699 -700 -701 -702 703 -704 -705 -706 -707 -708 -709 -710 -711 -712 -713 -714 -715 -716 -717 718 -719 -720 -721 -722 -723 -724 -725 -726 -727 -728 729 This answer must now be parsed: each positive value indicates the corresponding spot contains the corresponding value. For example, the value 661 is positive. And the variable 661 means 9;2=4 ; so, the value at line 9, column 2 is 4 . Representing a sudoku puzzle can seem tedious, but once it is done, the process can be easily automated and used for any other puzzle. Automated planning Let's say we have a small factory that should be running 24/7. Now, we have a few constraints: an employee should only work 8 hours at most in a given day, an employee should at most work 5 days per week, there must be at least one employee at any given moment, we only want to hire 4 employees. Now, to simplify things, we consider there are 3 working time slots per day: night(12AM - 7AM), morning(7AM - 2PM) and afternoon(2PM - 12AM). How could we generate a timetable for our employees? Variables Let's deal with variables first. There are 7*3=21 time slots and 4 employees, so we will have at least 21*4=84 variables, each variable meaning employee-x-works-on-day-y-timeslot-z , or, as a shortcut x=y;z . Now, that could be enough, but to simplify the writing of our formula, let's add a few variables, to indicate employee-x-works-on-day-y , with no time slot indicated, or, as a shortcut x=dy . There will be 4*7=28 such variables, i.e 112 total variables. Employees work only 8 hours a day This is akin to a unique constraint: given a set of variable, exactly one must be true. But, here, this is not an \"exactly one\" constraint, this is an \"at most one\" constraint: an employee does not necessarily work on a given day, but if he does, he only works during one time slot. So, for employee 1 on day 1, we will have the following set of clauses: not(1=1;1) or not(1=1;2) not(1=1;1) or not(1=1;3) not(1=1;2) or not(1=1;3) And we will do the same for the 7 days, for all 4 employees, leading to the generation of 3*7*4=84 clauses. At least one employee in each timeslot That's an easy one: for each time slot, we indicate that one of the 4 variables representing each employee for that time slot is true. So, for monday night (day 1, time slot 1), this will be: 1 = 1 ; 1 or 2 = 1 ; 1 or 3 = 1 ; 1 or 4 = 1 ; 1 Whether we have one, two, three or all four employees working, this clause will be true. We do the same for all 21 time slots, leading to the generation of 21 clauses. Employees work at most 5 days per week This one is a little trickier. No, we want our workers to have at most five working days, meaning that, for each set of 6 days, at least one must be a day off. For employee 1, this will lead to the generation of these clauses: not(1=d1) or not(1=d2) or not(1=d3) or not(1=d4) or not(1=d5) or not(1=d6) not(1=d1) or not(1=d2) or not(1=d3) or not(1=d4) or not(1=d5) or not(1=d7) not(1=d1) or not(1=d2) or not(1=d3) or not(1=d4) or not(1=d6) or not(1=d7) not(1=d1) or not(1=d2) or not(1=d3) or not(1=d5) or not(1=d6) or not(1=d7) not(1=d1) or not(1=d2) or not(1=d4) or not(1=d5) or not(1=d6) or not(1=d7) not(1=d1) or not(1=d3) or not(1=d4) or not(1=d5) or not(1=d6) or not(1=d7) not(1=d2) or not(1=d3) or not(1=d4) or not(1=d5) or not(1=d6) or not(1=d7) So, for all 4 employees, we will have 4*7=28 more clauses. Linking x=y;z variables with x=dy ones We must link both types of variables: if an employee works on day 1, that means he either works on day1-slot1, on day1-slot2 or on day1-slot3. For employee 1, that means: 1 = d1 <-> ( 1 = 1 ; 1 or 1 = 1 ; 2 or 1 = 1 ; 3 ) In CNF: not(1=1;1) or 1=d1 not(1=1;2) or 1=d1 not(1=1;3) or 1=d1 not(1=d1) or 1=1;1 or 1=1;2 or 1=1;3 For each day and each employee, we have to generate 4*7*4=112 clauses. Translation to DIMACS We need to associate each variable with an integer identifiant. Let's say x=y;z be associated with (x-1)*21 + (y-1)*3 + z . That leads to the generation of 84 variables. We also need a different identifier for each variable of the kind x=dy . We will associate them with the value 84 + (x-1)*7 + y . The DIMACS file is available for download. When we feed it to gophersat, it answers UNSATISFIABLE Oops! Looks like there is no way to solve our problem. Actually, we could have found that without a solver: there are 4 employees, and each employee works at most during 5 timeslots, meaning only 5*4=20 time slots with an employee at most. But there are 7*3=21 time slots to fill. We need to relax our constraints. Let's say we decide to hire a fifth employee. We rewrite our problem, as described in DIMACS file timetable5.cnf and ask gophersat his advice. The solver answers: SATISFIABLE -1 2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 -11 12 13 -14 -15 16 -17 -18 -19 -20 21 -22 -23 -24 25 -26 -27 28 -29 -30 -31 32 -33 -34 -35 -36 -37 38 -39 40 -41 -42 43 -44 -45 -46 -47 48 -49 50 -51 -52 -53 -54 -55 56 -57 -58 -59 -60 -61 62 -63 -64 -65 66 -67 68 -69 -70 -71 72 73 -74 -75 -76 -77 78 -79 -80 -81 -82 -83 -84 -85 -86 -87 -88 -89 -90 -91 -92 -93 -94 -95 -96 -97 -98 -99 -100 -101 102 -103 -104 -105 106 -107 -108 109 110 111 112 -113 114 115 116 -117 118 119 120 121 122 -123 124 -125 126 127 128 129 130 131 -132 -133 -134 -135 -136 -137 -138 139 -140 Great! Now, we have to translate this answer, by checking what each positive value means. Here, the solver gave us the following timetable: 1 = 1 ; 2 1 = 4 ; 3 1 = 5 ; 1 1 = 6 ; 1 1 = 7 ; 3 2 = 2 ; 1 2 = 3 ; 1 2 = 4 ; 2 2 = 6 ; 2 2 = 7 ; 1 3 = 1 ; 1 3 = 2 ; 3 3 = 3 ; 2 3 = 5 ; 2 3 = 7 ; 2 4 = 1 ; 3 4 = 2 ; 2 4 = 3 ; 3 4 = 4 ; 1 4 = 5 ; 3 5 = 6 ; 3 Everything is okay now. All employees from 1 to 4 work only five days a week, and part-time employee 5 fills the last, unassigned slot.","title":"Sat For Noobs"},{"location":"docs/external/sat-for-noobs/#the-sat-problem-for-noobs","text":"Originally posted at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crillab/gophersat/master/examples/sat-for-noobs.md This document gives an overview of the SAT problem, and how to use a SAT solver to solve a given problem.

Imagine you have a boolean formula , i.e a formula containing boolean variables . For instance: (a and (b or not(c))) or (not(b) and c) In this formula, a , b and c can either be true or false. The SAT problem is the problem of finding an assignment for these variables so that the whole formula becomes true, if such an assignment exists. This assignment is called a model , and a formula can have zero, one or several models. In the above problem, a=false, b=true, c=false is not a model of the formula, because (false and (true or not(false))) or (not(true) and false) reduces to false . However, the assignment a=true, b=true, c=false is a model, because (true and (true or not(false))) or (not(true) and false) reduces to true . Now, the trivial problem a and not(a) has no model, because there is no way to make this formula true, no matter the value associated with a . This formula is said to be unsatisfiable (UNSAT for short).","title":"What is the SAT problem?"},{"location":"docs/external/sat-for-noobs/#what-is-a-sat-solver","text":"A SAT solver is a piece of software that, when given a formula (more on the input syntax below), returns either one model, if at least one model exists, or the indication that the problem is unsatisfiable . Implementing such a piece of software is rather easy, but there's one little problem: the SAT problem is NP-complete, meaning all known algorithms to solve it take an exponential time (worse-case complexity is O(k^n) , with k > 1 ), and we're not even sure there is a way to make a non-exponential algorithm (this is the famous \"P = NP\" problem). So, the most trivial algorithm to solve the SAT problem (test all possible assignments for all variables, stop when one makes the formula true, return UNSAT once all assignments were unsuccessful), has a worse-case complexity of O(2^n) . That means there are, for instance, more than 1 billion assignments to test for a formula with 30 variables, and about 1.27 * 10^30 for a formula with 100 variables: the time to solve a very simple problem is unacceptable. But all hope is not lost. The first good news is that exponential does not necessarily mean 2^n . It means k^n , with k > 1 . Solving the SAT problem is a whole research field, and algorithms are more and more efficient, trying to bring k as close to 1 as possible. Because, for instance, although an algorithm with a worst-case complexity of O(1.01^n) is still exponential, there are only about 400 million operations to solve a problem with 2000 variables. The second good news is that practical, real-world, industrial problems are generally structured in such a way that worst-case complexity is just a theoretical limit. Those problems are usually easier to solve than theoretical ones. The third good news is that, according to the Cook-Levin theorem, any NP-complete problem can be translated in a SAT problem, meaning all the research effort in emproving the efficiency of SAT solvers also profits all other NP-complete problems. In other words, when you are facing an NP-complete problem, you can either try to develop a specific algorithm to solve it, use a dedicated piece of software (if such a software exists) or try to translate it to SAT and use a SAT solver.","title":"What is a SAT solver?"},{"location":"docs/external/sat-for-noobs/#what-is-the-input-format-of-a-sat-solver-how-do-i-represent-my-problem","text":"","title":"What is the input format of a SAT solver?

Any boolean formula can be translated to an equivalent CNF formula in polynomial time, although the process can sometimes be tricky. For instance, the formula (a and (b or not(c))) or (not(b) and c) is equivalent to the following CNF formula (x1 or x2) and (not(x1) or a) and (not(x1) or b or not(c)) and (not(x2) or not(b)) and (not(x2) or c) Note that a few more variables had to be introduced.","title":"Conjunctive Normal Form"},{"location":"docs/external/sat-for-noobs/#dimacs-format","text":"the standard way of describing a CNF formula is through the DIMACS syntax.

A clause is described as a list of integer values separated by spaces, and ending with th value 0. That means each variable must be translated as an integer value. Negation is represented by the minus sign. For instance, let's say a is 1, b is 2, c is 3, x1 is 4, x2 is 5. The clause not(x2) or c will be translated as -5 3 0 . The above formula will then be written as: p cnf 5 5 4 5 0 -4 1 0 -4 2 -3 0 -5 -2 0 -5 3 0 The SAT solver, when given an input, will then return either the string UNSATISFIABLE or the string SATISFIABLE with an assignment that makes the formula true. For instance, when fed the formula above, Gophersat will answer: SATISFIABLE -1 -2 3 -4 5 It means that, when both c and x2 are true, and all other variables are false, the whole formula becomes true. Since x1 and x2 were dummy variables we introduced to make our original formula a CNF, we can say that our original formula is true when a=false, b=false, c=true .

Let's explore these impacts in detail and consider effective approaches: Energy Depletion and Recharging Needs The need to recharge through specific activities like playing Factorio or reading books reflects a fundamental aspect of neurodivergent energy management: Understanding Your Energy Pattern Cognitive Battery Depletion Your brain likely expends significantly more energy on everyday tasks than neurotypical individuals. This creates a genuine physiological need for recovery, not just a preference for gaming or reading. Special Interest Recharging Games like Factorio provide structured, predictable environments with clear feedback loops\u2014perfect for replenishing depleted executive function. The game's systems-based nature offers: Dopamine rewards through achievement Reduced sensory/social processing demands Flow states that allow executive function systems to recover Reading as Cognitive Restoration Reading similarly creates a contained world with controlled input, allowing your brain to engage deeply without the unpredictability of real-world interactions. Physiological Basis This recharging need isn't laziness\u2014it's your nervous system requiring regulation. Research suggests neurodivergent individuals often experience: - Faster depletion of neurotransmitters during task-switching - Higher baseline cognitive load from environmental processing - Greater recovery needs after sustained attention Inability to Go Deep and Open Loop Overwhelm The second challenge\u2014feeling overwhelmed by open loops and struggling to dive deeply into projects\u2014is intricately connected to the first: The Open Loop Cycle Working Memory Limitations Each unfinished task occupies valuable working memory space, creating cognitive background noise that prevents deep focus. Task-Switching Penalties Every context switch between open loops incurs a 15-25 minute refocusing cost, which compounds exponentially with more loops. Depth vs. Breadth Conflict Your brain may naturally prefer monotropic focus (going deep on one thing) but is forced into polytropic mode (juggling many things) by life demands. The Depth-Energy Connection These challenges are interconnected in a feedback loop: - More open loops \u2192 More energy depletion \u2192 Greater need for recharging activities - Less deep focus time \u2192 Fewer completed projects \u2192 More open loops accumulate Integrated Management Approach Addressing these twin challenges requires a unified strategy: 1. Energy Accounting Recognize Recharging as Essential Schedule Factorio or reading time as non-negotiable recovery periods, not \"rewards\" or \"leisure.\" Energy Tracking Monitor your energy patterns to identify when you need recharging before hitting complete depletion. Strategic Timing Plan high-focus work during peak energy periods (likely mornings) and recovery activities during natural energy dips. 2. Open Loop Reduction Brutal Prioritization Identify the vital 20% of open loops that deliver 80% of value and temporarily shelve the rest. External Capture Systems Move open loops from your working memory into reliable external systems (digital or physical). Completion Thresholds Define clear \"done\" criteria for projects to prevent perfectionism from keeping loops open. 3. Deep Work Protection Depth Blocks Schedule 2-3 hour protected blocks for deep work, with all notifications disabled. Environment Design Create a dedicated deep work space with minimal visual/auditory distractions. Transition Rituals Develop consistent routines to signal your brain it's time to shift into deep focus mode. Practical Next Steps Legitimize Recovery Reframe Factorio and reading as \"cognitive restoration,\" not procrastination or escapism. Implement Project Limits Cap active projects at 3-5 maximum; formally pause everything else. Create Energy Reserves Schedule recovery time before you need it, preventing complete depletion.

Here are some key points and resources to help you achieve this: Understanding the Structure of Research Articles IMRAD Structure : Research articles typically follow the IMRAD structure, which includes Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Understanding this structure helps in systematically evaluating an article[2][3]. Evaluating Articles Systematic Approach : Start by reading the abstract and conclusions to decide if the article is worth reading in full. This approach helps in filtering out irrelevant or poorly conducted studies[2][4]. PP-ICONS Approach : Use the PP-ICONS method to evaluate the validity and relevance of clinical articles. This acronym stands for Problem, Patient or population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Number of subjects, and Study design[4]. Critical Thinking : Critical thinking is crucial when evaluating research. Ask questions like what the authors want to know, what they did, why they did it that way, what the results show, how the authors interpreted the results, and what should be done next[3]. Resources for Learning Users' Guide to the Medical Literature : JAMA's Users' Guide to the Medical Literature collection provides foundational knowledge on understanding and interpreting clinical research, including how to evaluate study designs and outcomes[5]. PubMed Tutorials : PubMed offers tutorials and guides on how to search and evaluate medical literature effectively, which can be a valuable resource for learning[1]. Best Practices Focus on High-Quality Studies : Prioritize systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as these are considered the gold standard in medical research[4][5]. Stay Updated : Regularly update your knowledge by following reputable sources and using alerts for new publications in your area of interest[3][5]. By following these guidelines and utilizing the recommended resources, you can become a more competent and responsible user of scientific and medical research on PubMed, ensuring that your conclusions and actions are based on accurate and reliable information. #### Citations [1] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3687192/ [3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392212/ [4] https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2004/0500/p47.html [5] https://jamanetwork.com/collections/44069/users-guide-to-the-medical-literature [6] https://www.migrantclinician.org/streamline/best-practices-interpretation","title":"Be A Science User"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/be_a_science_user/#becoming-a-user-of-scientific-medical-research","text":"To become a competent user of scientific and medical research resources like PubMed, it's essential to develop critical reading skills and understand how to evaluate the validity and relevance of research articles.

The techniques in this document do. Explanation of \"Happiness Set Point\" AKA \"Hedonic Treadmill\" This section is not by GPT-4. Most of the document is. It's not really a more or less reliable narrator than me. From wikipedia: Hedonic Treadmill Note that \"happiness set point\" and \"hedonic treadmill\" are the same concept. Importantly, the \"happiness set point\" can easily be changed. Things that bring you immediate feelings, e.g. joy or sadness, do not change your overall happiness. Note that circumstances, e.g. \"life events\" can change your happiness, and need managed differently, although generally as humans our most important skills for these events are are coping with things we cannot control and controlling things we should. The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes. Headey (2008) concluded that an internal locus of control (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) and having \"positive\" personality traits (notably low neuroticism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism)) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being. Headey also found that adopting \"non-zero sum\" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's disposable income (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction. Daily Happiness Checklist This checklist came from combining the suggestions from: - \"reducing neuroticism\" - \"increasing locus of control\" - \"improving your happiness set point\" Daily Happiness Checklist (Revised Order by Effectiveness) Sleep Hygiene (7-9 hours) Prioritize getting sufficient, quality sleep each night, as sleep is crucial for overall well-being and happiness. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule and establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Physical Activity (30 minutes) Engage in your preferred form of exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, yoga, or swimming) to boost mood and reduce stress. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (variable time) Use CBT techniques, such as challenging negative thoughts and restructuring cognitive distortions, to improve mood and overall well-being. Consider working with a therapist or using self-help resources. Morning Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes) Find a quiet space and spend time focusing on your breath or a mantra to start your day with a calm mind. Social Connection (variable time) Reach out to friends or family members through a phone call, text, or in-person visit to maintain and strengthen relationships. Acts of Kindness (variable time) Perform small acts of kindness for others, such as helping a neighbor, complimenting someone, or volunteering. This can boost happiness by promoting positive emotions and fostering social connections. Time in Nature (15-30 minutes) Spend time outdoors in natural settings, such as a park, forest, or beach. Exposure to nature has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and increase well-being. Problem-Solving Practice (10-15 minutes) Identify a challenge you are currently facing, brainstorm possible solutions, and take a small step toward resolving the issue. Goal Review and Progress (5-10 minutes) Reflect on your long-term goals, review the short-term actionable steps you've outlined, and track your progress. Positive Affirmations (5 minutes) Recite affirmations that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors, promoting self-confidence and an internal locus of control. Gratitude Journaling (10 minutes) Write down three things you are grateful for each day to cultivate a positive mindset and increase happiness. Laughter and Humor (variable time) Make time to watch a funny movie, read a humorous book, or share jokes with friends. Laughter can reduce stress, improve mood, and promote feelings of happiness. Deep Breathing Exercises (5-10 minutes) Practice deep breathing exercises throughout the day to help manage stress and maintain a sense of calm. Nurturing Hobbies (variable time) Engage in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and fulfillment, such as painting, playing a musical instrument, gardening, or cooking. Evening Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes) Wind down with another session of mindfulness meditation, focusing on releasing any stress or tension from the day. Please note that the effectiveness of each activity may vary depending on individual preferences and experiences. The revised order provided above takes into consideration the importance of certain items, but you should still adjust the checklist according to your personal needs and priorities. Reducing your \"Neuroticism\" To reduce neuroticism: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Alters thought patterns, reducing negative thinking associated with neuroticism. Mindfulness: Reduces anxiety, promotes self-acceptance. Physical Activity: Reduces stress, promotes mood stability. Develop Coping Skills: Strategies to manage stress help mitigate neurotic reactions. Increase Your \"Locus of Control\" Problem-Solving: Identify challenges, generate solutions, take action, reflect on the outcome. Affirmations: Positive self-statements that emphasize control over personal choices and behaviors. Goal Setting: Long-term vision with short-term actionable steps promotes a sense of control. Mindfulness: Practice staying present-focused rather than worrying about uncontrollable future events. Improving happiness set point involves psychological interventions Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): It focuses on changing thought patterns. Negative thoughts can drag down your happiness set point. Mindfulness Meditation: Regular practice can increase baseline happiness, as it helps reduce stress and promote relaxation. Regular Exercise: It can release chemicals called endorphins which can make you feel happier. Maintain Social Connections: Strong, positive relationships are essential for happiness. Practice Gratitude: Reflecting on positive experiences can boost happiness levels. Rubric: Evidence based (1-3 points), applicability (1-3 points), detail level (1-3 points). Confidence: CBT: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (2/3), Detail (2/3) Mindfulness: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (3/3), Detail (2/3) Exercise: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (3/3), Detail (2/3) Social Connections: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (3/3), Detail (2/3) Gratitude: Evidence (3/3), Applicability (2/3), Detail (2/3) Overall, I am fairly confident in these recommendations based on scientific literature. However, individual experiences can vary. Detailed Activities Solo CBT robbintt@gpt-4 12> Is CBT a solo activity CBT, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is traditionally a form of psychotherapy conducted with a licensed therapist. In this setting, it is not a solo activity, as you work together with the therapist to identify and address negative thought patterns and cognitive distortions. However, there are also self-help resources and books available that teach CBT techniques that can be practiced individually. In this case, CBT can be considered a solo activity. Keep in mind that practicing CBT on your own may not be as effective as working with a trained professional, especially when addressing more severe mental health concerns. In summary, CBT can be both a solo activity (using self-help resources) and a collaborative activity (working with a therapist). The choice depends on individual needs, preferences, and the severity of the issues being addressed. (0.7/8192/5345) robbintt@gpt-4 13> What is the research around solo cbt Research on self-guided or solo Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown promising results. Several studies have found that self-help CBT interventions can be effective for treating various mental health conditions, particularly mild to moderate anxiety and depression. A meta-analysis of 40 studies on self-help CBT interventions (Andersson & Cuijpers, 2009) showed that these interventions had a moderate effect size in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Another meta-analysis of 15 studies (Cuijpers et al., 2009) examining self-help interventions for depression found a moderate effect size as well. It is important to note, however, that self-guided CBT may not be as effective as therapist-guided CBT for more severe mental health issues or complex cases. Additionally, self-help interventions may not provide the same level of support, personalization, and feedback as working with a trained professional. Despite these limitations, self-guided CBT can be a useful option for individuals who may not have access to a therapist, cannot afford therapy, or prefer to work independently. It can be an accessible starting point for those seeking to improve their mental well-being. References: Andersson, G., & Cuijpers, P. (2009).

Learn CBT techniques: Study various CBT techniques, such as thought records, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral activation. You can find these techniques in self-help books, online resources, or mobile apps designed for CBT practice. Identify your negative thoughts and cognitive distortions: Start by observing your thoughts, especially when you experience strong emotions. Recognize common cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking, magnification, and personalization. Keep a thought journal: Record your thoughts, emotions, and situations that trigger negative thinking patterns. Note any cognitive distortions and their intensity. Challenge negative thoughts: Question the accuracy and validity of your negative thoughts. Analyze the evidence supporting and contradicting these thoughts and consider alternative explanations. Cognitive restructuring: Replace negative thoughts with more balanced and rational alternatives. Practice this by reframing your thoughts to be more objective and less emotionally charged. Set behavioral goals: Identify and set small, achievable goals that promote positive behaviors and experiences. These goals could include engaging in enjoyable activities, overcoming procrastination, or improving social connections. Monitor your progress: Regularly review your thought journal and progress towards your behavioral goals. Make adjustments as needed and celebrate your successes. Practice mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness meditation or other mindfulness techniques into your daily routine to enhance self-awareness and emotional regulation. Seek support if needed: If you find solo CBT challenging or feel that your mental health concerns are too complex to address on your own, consider seeking professional guidance from a therapist or counselor. Remember that self-guided CBT may not be as effective as working with a trained professional, especially for more severe mental health concerns. However, it can be a helpful starting point for those seeking to improve their well-being and manage mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression.

Speak with conviction: Recite your affirmations out loud, with confidence and conviction. You can also say them silently or write them down if you prefer. Visualization: As you recite your affirmations, visualize yourself embodying the positive qualities and emotions they represent. This mental imagery can help reinforce the affirmations and create a stronger emotional connection. Repetition: Repeat your affirmations multiple times during each session to help solidify them in your mind. Be consistent and patient: Practice affirmations consistently over time to experience their full benefits. Change takes time, so be patient and trust the process. Monitor your progress: Periodically review your affirmations to ensure they still align with your goals and values. Update or modify them as needed to reflect your personal growth and development. Remember, the effectiveness of affirmations may vary for individuals, and it's essential to find an approach that works best for you. Consistency and repetition are key to reaping the benefits of positive affirmations. Example Affirmations Here's a list of example affirmations covering various aspects of life.

Personalize these examples or create your own affirmations that resonate with you and reflect your personal goals. Practicing Gratitude robbintt@gpt-4 19> how do i practice gratitude? Practicing gratitude involves cultivating a mindset of appreciation and thankfulness for the positive aspects of your life. Here are some ways to practice gratitude: Gratitude journal: Dedicate a notebook or journal specifically for gratitude. Each day, write down three things you're grateful for. They can be small, like a delicious meal, or more significant, like a supportive friend. Over time, this practice will help you focus more on the positive aspects of your life. Express gratitude to others: When someone helps or supports you, make a conscious effort to express your appreciation. This can be as simple as saying \"thank you\" or writing a heartfelt note or message. Gratitude meditation: Spend a few minutes each day in quiet reflection, focusing on the things you're grateful for. Visualize the people, experiences, and circumstances that bring you joy and contentment. Gratitude jar: Set up a jar in a visible location in your home and keep small slips of paper nearby. Whenever you feel grateful for something, write it down and place it in the jar. Over time, you'll accumulate a collection of positive memories and experiences. Share gratitude with others: During casual conversations or at the dinner table, take turns sharing something you're grateful for. This practice can help create a positive atmosphere and strengthen relationships. Mindful moments: Throughout the day, pause and take a moment to appreciate the present moment and your surroundings. This can help you cultivate gratitude for the small, everyday pleasures in life. Reflect on challenges: Consider how past challenges have helped you grow and learn. By finding the silver lining in difficult situations, you can develop a deeper sense of gratitude for your life experiences. Volunteer or help others: Giving back to your community or helping someone in need can foster a sense of gratitude for your own circumstances and the opportunity to make a difference in others' lives. Create gratitude reminders: Set up reminders in your phone, on sticky notes, or through a visual cue to prompt you to pause and reflect on something you're grateful for. Practice gratitude before bedtime: As you wind down for the night, spend a few moments reflecting on the positive aspects of your day. This can help shift your mindset and promote better sleep. Remember, practicing gratitude is a habit that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and try different methods to find what works best for you. Consistency is key to experiencing the benefits of gratitude practice. Mindfulness Meditation Q: how do I do mindfulness meditation? Mindfulness meditation is a practice that focuses on building awareness of the present moment and accepting it without judgment. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with mindfulness meditation: Find a quiet space: Choose a location where you can sit or lie down comfortably without distractions or interruptions. Set a timer: Decide on the duration of your meditation session, especially if you're a beginner. You can start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice. Choose a comfortable position: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, maintaining a relaxed but upright posture. You can sit cross-legged on the floor, on a cushion, or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Close your eyes: Gently close your eyes or, if you prefer, maintain a soft gaze a few feet in front of you. Focus on your breath: Pay attention to your natural breathing pattern. Observe the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. You don't need to change your breath, just be aware of it. Accept wandering thoughts: It's normal for your mind to wander during meditation. When you notice your thoughts drifting, gently acknowledge them and bring your focus back to your breath without judgment. This process of noticing and refocusing is a key part of mindfulness meditation. Use an anchor: If you find it difficult to focus on your breath, you can use an alternative anchor for your attention, such as a word, phrase, or mantra that you silently repeat to yourself. Expand your awareness: As you become more comfortable with the practice, you can expand your focus to include other sensations or experiences in the present moment, such as sounds, bodily sensations, or emotions. End your meditation: When your timer goes off or you feel ready to end your session, take a few moments to notice your surroundings and gradually bring your awareness back to the room. Gently open your eyes and take a few deep breaths before returning to your daily activities. Remember, mindfulness meditation is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself and try to maintain a non-judgmental attitude towards your thoughts and experiences. Q: Isn't there research about focusing on your breath? Yes, there is research on the benefits of focusing on your breath during mindfulness meditation and other relaxation practices. Focusing on your breath is a fundamental technique in mindfulness meditation that helps anchor your attention in the present moment and develop greater self-awareness. Research has shown that focusing on your breath during mindfulness meditation can lead to various positive outcomes, such as: Reduced stress: Mindfulness meditation, including breath-focused practices, has been shown to reduce stress by activating the body's relaxation response and decreasing the production of stress hormones. Improved emotional regulation: Focusing on your breath can help you develop greater awareness of your emotions and improve your ability to regulate them, leading to better emotional well-being. Enhanced attention and focus: Breath-focused meditation has been found to improve attention and focus by promoting mental clarity and reducing distractions. Reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression: Studies have shown that mindfulness meditation, including breath-focused techniques, can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression by promoting a more balanced and positive mindset. Improved overall well-being: Regular practice of mindfulness meditation that includes breath focus can lead to an increased sense of well-being and life satisfaction. In summary, focusing on your breath during mindfulness meditation is a well-researched technique that has been shown to provide numerous psychological benefits, including stress reduction, improved emotional regulation, enhanced attention, and overall well-being.","title":"Increasing Happiness Praxis"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/increasing-happiness-praxis/#praxis-increasing-happiness","text":"Put simply, your reactions and emotions don't change your baseline happiness.

(0.7/8192/5345) robbintt@gpt-4 13> What is the research around solo cbt Research on self-guided or solo Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown promising results. Several studies have found that self-help CBT interventions can be effective for treating various mental health conditions, particularly mild to moderate anxiety and depression. A meta-analysis of 40 studies on self-help CBT interventions (Andersson & Cuijpers, 2009) showed that these interventions had a moderate effect size in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Another meta-analysis of 15 studies (Cuijpers et al., 2009) examining self-help interventions for depression found a moderate effect size as well. It is important to note, however, that self-guided CBT may not be as effective as therapist-guided CBT for more severe mental health issues or complex cases. Additionally, self-help interventions may not provide the same level of support, personalization, and feedback as working with a trained professional. Despite these limitations, self-guided CBT can be a useful option for individuals who may not have access to a therapist, cannot afford therapy, or prefer to work independently. It can be an accessible starting point for those seeking to improve their mental well-being. References: Andersson, G., & Cuijpers, P. (2009).

Mindfulness meditation is a practice that focuses on building awareness of the present moment and accepting it without judgment. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with mindfulness meditation: Find a quiet space: Choose a location where you can sit or lie down comfortably without distractions or interruptions. Set a timer: Decide on the duration of your meditation session, especially if you're a beginner. You can start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice. Choose a comfortable position: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, maintaining a relaxed but upright posture. You can sit cross-legged on the floor, on a cushion, or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Close your eyes: Gently close your eyes or, if you prefer, maintain a soft gaze a few feet in front of you. Focus on your breath: Pay attention to your natural breathing pattern. Observe the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. You don't need to change your breath, just be aware of it. Accept wandering thoughts: It's normal for your mind to wander during meditation. When you notice your thoughts drifting, gently acknowledge them and bring your focus back to your breath without judgment. This process of noticing and refocusing is a key part of mindfulness meditation. Use an anchor: If you find it difficult to focus on your breath, you can use an alternative anchor for your attention, such as a word, phrase, or mantra that you silently repeat to yourself. Expand your awareness: As you become more comfortable with the practice, you can expand your focus to include other sensations or experiences in the present moment, such as sounds, bodily sensations, or emotions. End your meditation: When your timer goes off or you feel ready to end your session, take a few moments to notice your surroundings and gradually bring your awareness back to the room. Gently open your eyes and take a few deep breaths before returning to your daily activities. Remember, mindfulness meditation is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself and try to maintain a non-judgmental attitude towards your thoughts and experiences. Q: Isn't there research about focusing on your breath? Yes, there is research on the benefits of focusing on your breath during mindfulness meditation and other relaxation practices. Focusing on your breath is a fundamental technique in mindfulness meditation that helps anchor your attention in the present moment and develop greater self-awareness.

Reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression: Studies have shown that mindfulness meditation, including breath-focused techniques, can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression by promoting a more balanced and positive mindset. Improved overall well-being: Regular practice of mindfulness meditation that includes breath focus can lead to an increased sense of well-being and life satisfaction. In summary, focusing on your breath during mindfulness meditation is a well-researched technique that has been shown to provide numerous psychological benefits, including stress reduction, improved emotional regulation, enhanced attention, and overall well-being.","title":"Mindfulness Meditation"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/learning-how-to-learn-summary-revised2025/","text":"Learning How to Learn: A Comprehensive Guide for Effective Studying (and Prompting AI) Introduction This guide condenses key principles from \"Learning How to Learn,\" primarily based on the Coursera course by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. Its purpose is twofold: 1. To provide you with a robust understanding of effective learning strategies grounded in neuroscience. 2. To structure these principles in a way that you can easily use them to prompt an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) to generate personalized learning aids such as Anki cards, outlines, summaries, and quizzes. Each section will explain a core concept, its importance, practical application tips, and a sample prompt you could use with an AI. (Current Date: May 18, 2025) Core Learning Principles & AI Prompts 1. Focused and Diffuse Modes of Thinking Explanation: Our brain operates in two distinct modes. Focused Mode: A state of concentrated attention, using logical, sequential, and analytical approaches to solve problems or learn something specific. This is when you're actively working on a problem or absorbing detailed information. Diffuse Mode: A relaxed, \"big-picture\" thinking state. It operates in the background and can make connections and insights when you're not actively focusing on a problem (e.g., while showering, walking, or resting). Importance: Both modes are essential for effective learning. Focused mode is for initial understanding and detail work, while diffuse mode helps consolidate learning, see connections, and solve complex problems where you might get stuck. How to Leverage: Consciously switch between modes. After a period of focused work (e.g., a Pomodoro session), take a break and do something relaxing to engage the diffuse mode. If you're stuck on a problem, step away. Your diffuse mode will often work on it in the background. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain the 'Focused Mode' and 'Diffuse Mode' of thinking. Create three Anki cards (front/back) defining each mode and highlighting a key difference. Describe a scenario where a student learning to code would benefit from intentionally switching from focused to diffuse mode, and what activity could facilitate this switch. ``` 2. Chunking Explanation: Chunking is the process of breaking down complex information or tasks into smaller, manageable pieces or \"chunks.\" These chunks are then understood and practiced individually before being linked together to grasp the larger concept. Importance: Our working memory is limited. Chunking makes information easier to process, understand, and recall. It helps build a library of mental patterns. Practical Steps (especially for programmers): Identify a Topic/Task: e.g., Learning a new programming function or concept like \"Asynchronous JavaScript.\" Break It Down: Divide the topic into its fundamental components (e.g., for async JS: callbacks, promises, async/await syntax, error handling). Focus on One Chunk: Master each component. Understand its syntax, purpose, and basic use. Practice and Understand Context: Practice just that chunk until it makes sense. Don't just memorize; understand how and why it works. Link Chunks: Combine learned chunks to build more complex understanding or applications. See how they fit together. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain the 'Chunking' technique for learning. I am a programmer learning about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Provide a practical outline for how I can use chunking to understand the concept of 'Classes and Objects'. List at least 3 distinct 'chunks' I should focus on initially. For each chunk, suggest one simple coding exercise. ``` 3. Active Recall (Self-Testing) Explanation: Actively retrieving information from memory, rather than passively reviewing it (like rereading notes or highlighting). Importance: This is one of the most potent learning strategies. It strengthens neural pathways, improves long-term retention, and helps identify knowledge gaps, combating \"Illusions of Competence.\" Methods: Closing the book and recalling key concepts. Using flashcards (physical or digital like Anki). Answering questions at the end of a chapter before looking up answers. Teaching the concept to someone else (or even an inanimate object). Drawing mind maps from memory. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain 'Active Recall' and why it's more effective than passive review. I am studying the Water Cycle for a biology class. Generate 5 example Anki card prompts (front/back) that use active recall for key concepts in the Water Cycle. Suggest 3 ways I can incorporate active recall into my daily study routine for this class. ``` 4. Spaced Repetition Explanation: A learning technique that involves reviewing material at increasing intervals over time. This principle is based on the \"forgetting curve,\" which shows that we tend to forget information rapidly if we don't revisit it. Importance: Dramatically improves long-term memory retention by interrupting the forgetting process at optimal times. How to Implement: Manually: Review notes after 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week, then 2 weeks, etc. Software: Use tools like Anki, SuperMemo, or Quizlet that have built-in spaced repetition system (SRS) algorithms. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, define 'Spaced Repetition' and explain its relationship to the 'forgetting curve.' Provide a sample 5-step spaced repetition schedule (e.g., Day 1, Day 3, Day 7...) for learning a new set of 10 vocabulary words. List and briefly describe two digital tools that facilitate spaced repetition. ``` 5. Interleaving Explanation: Mixing up the practice of different types of problems, skills, or concepts in a single study session, rather than practicing one type extensively before moving to the next (blocked practice). Importance: Helps develop a deeper understanding, improves the ability to discriminate between different problem types, and enhances the transfer of learning to new contexts. It feels harder initially but leads to better long-term results. Application for Programmers: Instead of doing 20 Python loop problems, then 20 Python conditional problems, mix them up. If learning web development, switch between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tasks within a study session. Work on different types of coding challenges that require varied approaches. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain 'Interleaving' as a study technique and contrast it with 'Blocked Practice.' I am learning basic calculus, specifically differentiation rules (power rule, product rule, quotient rule). Design a 1-hour study session plan that uses interleaving for these three rules. Generate a 3-question quiz that interleaves problems requiring these different differentiation rules. ``` 6. Illusions of Competence Explanation: The feeling that you understand or have mastered material when you actually haven't. This often arises from passive review techniques. Importance: Recognizing and avoiding these illusions is crucial for effective studying. Wasting time on ineffective strategies gives a false sense of security. Common Traps: Rereading: Familiarity with the text is mistaken for understanding. Excessive Highlighting: Can be passive and gives the illusion of engagement without real learning. Looking at Solutions Too Soon: Robs you of the beneficial struggle needed to learn. Strategies to Avoid: Prioritize active recall and self-testing. Explain concepts in your own words (Feynman technique). Work problems before looking at solutions. Minimize highlighting; if used, do it sparingly and then summarize highlighted points from memory. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, define 'Illusions of Competence' in the context of learning. List three common study habits that lead to illusions of competence. For each habit, suggest an active learning strategy to counteract it and promote genuine understanding. ``` 7. The Power of Sleep in Learning Explanation: Sleep plays a critical role in learning and memory. During sleep, the brain consolidates memories (strengthening important ones, discarding less important ones), clears metabolic toxins built up during wakefulness, and rehearses and processes information learned during the day. Importance: Adequate, quality sleep is essential for forming lasting memories, gaining insights, and maintaining cognitive function. Lack of sleep impairs attention, learning capacity, and problem-solving skills. Practical Advice: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule. A brief review of material before sleep can enhance consolidation. Ensure your sleep environment is conducive to rest. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain the importance of sleep for learning and memory. Summarize the top three benefits of sleep for memory consolidation and problem-solving. Provide two practical tips for optimizing sleep when preparing for an important exam. ``` 8. Overcoming Procrastination Explanation: Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing tasks, often due to discomfort or anxiety associated with the task. Learning, especially challenging material, can trigger this. Key Strategies: The Pomodoro Technique: Work in focused 25-minute intervals (Pomodoros) separated by short 5-minute breaks. After about 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). The key is to focus on the process (the 25 minutes of work) rather than the product (finishing the entire task), which makes starting easier. Reward yourself after completing a Pomodoro or a set of them. Process Over Product: Shift focus from the potentially overwhelming outcome to the manageable steps or time you'll invest. \"I will work on this for 25 minutes\" is less daunting than \"I will master this entire chapter.\" Managing Habits (The Habit Loop - Cue, Routine, Reward, Belief): Cue: Identify what triggers your procrastination (e.g., feeling overwhelmed, a specific time of day, a notification). Routine: The procrastination itself. Aim to change this to a productive study routine. Reward: What do you get from procrastinating (e.g., temporary relief, distraction)? Find a healthier reward for studying. Belief: Cultivate the belief that you can change your habits and succeed. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain common reasons for procrastination when studying. Describe the Pomodoro Technique in detail, including its components and benefits. How does focusing on 'process over product' help overcome procrastination? Create a 3-question short-answer quiz about these procrastination-beating strategies. ``` 9. Metaphors and Analogies Explanation: Using familiar concepts (analogies) or symbolic representations (metaphors) to understand and remember new, abstract, or complex ideas. Importance: They bridge the gap between new information and existing knowledge, making difficult concepts more intuitive and memorable. How to Use: Actively try to create your own metaphors and analogies when learning something new. Relate new concepts to things you already understand well from different fields. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain why metaphors and analogies are powerful tools for learning. I am trying to understand how a 'Virtual Private Network (VPN)' works. Generate two different analogies to help a beginner grasp this concept. Suggest a process for creating personal metaphors when learning a new technical term. ``` 10. Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset Explanation: Fixed Mindset: The belief that abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits \u2013 you either have them or you don't. Growth Mindset: The belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed over time through dedication, effort, effective strategies, and learning from mistakes. Importance: A growth mindset fosters resilience, a willingness to embrace challenges, persistence in the face of setbacks, and a greater likelihood of achieving potential. It's foundational to effective learning. Cultivating a Growth Mindset: Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. View effort as the path to mastery. Learn from criticism and feedback. Persist despite setbacks; see failure as a learning opportunity. Be inspired by the success of others. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, define 'Growth Mindset' and 'Fixed Mindset.' Create a table contrasting at least three characteristics of individuals with a Growth Mindset versus those with a Fixed Mindset, especially in response to challenges or failures. List three affirmations or self-talk statements that can help cultivate a Growth Mindset. ``` 11. The Value of Mistakes and Deliberate Practice Explanation: Mistakes: Are not failures but invaluable learning opportunities. Analyzing mistakes helps pinpoint misunderstandings and strengthen correct pathways. Deliberate Practice: A highly structured form of practice that involves focusing on specific areas of weakness, pushing slightly beyond current capabilities, and actively seeking feedback to improve. It's purposeful and systematic, not just mindless repetition. Importance: This approach accelerates skill acquisition and mastery far more effectively than simply repeating what one already does well. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain the role of 'mistakes' in the learning process. How does 'Deliberate Practice' differ from simple repetition or 'just doing it'? Provide 3 key components of an effective Deliberate Practice session for someone learning a musical instrument. ``` 12. Setting the Stage for Learning (Environment & Habits) Explanation: Your physical environment and established routines significantly impact your ability to focus and learn effectively. Importance: A conducive environment minimizes distractions and cues your brain for learning, while good habits automate the process of getting started and staying consistent. Tips: Minimize Distractions: Turn off notifications, find a quiet space, use website blockers if needed. Dedicated Study Space: If possible, have a space used only for studying to create a mental association. Build Routines (Harnessing \"Zombie Mode\"): Establish regular times and cues for studying. This reduces the mental effort needed to begin. Prepare Materials: Have everything you need ready before you start. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain how one's study environment and habits impact learning. List five actionable tips for creating an effective, distraction-free study environment. Describe how to use the concept of a 'habit loop' (cue, routine, reward) to build a consistent daily study habit. ``` 13. The Role of Exercise in Learning Explanation: Physical exercise has significant benefits for brain health and cognitive function. It can stimulate the creation of new neurons (neurogenesis), improve mood, reduce stress, and enhance attention and memory. Importance: Regular physical activity can make your brain more receptive to learning and better at retaining information. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, briefly explain how physical exercise supports learning and cognitive functions. List three specific cognitive benefits linked to regular physical activity. Suggest two simple ways to incorporate more movement into a typical student's day. ``` 14. Einstellung Effect (Mental Roadblocks) Explanation: The Einstellung Effect is a cognitive trap where an initial idea, a familiar solution, or a pre-existing mindset prevents you from seeing better, alternative, or simpler solutions to a problem. You get stuck in a mental rut. Importance: Recognizing this effect helps you consciously try different approaches, especially when you're stuck, fostering more creative and effective problem-solving. Overcoming It: The diffuse mode of thinking is particularly helpful here. Stepping back from the problem allows your brain to explore other neural pathways. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, define the 'Einstellung Effect' in problem-solving. Provide an example of how this effect might manifest when someone is trying to debug code. Suggest two strategies to overcome the Einstellung Effect, explicitly mentioning how the diffuse mode of thinking can help. ``` Conclusion Mastering these learning principles can transform your study habits and outcomes. By understanding how you learn best, you can study more efficiently and effectively. Use this guide to consciously apply these techniques and to prompt your AI assistant to create tailored learning materials that will help you solidify your understanding and recall of any subject.

Importance: Helps develop a deeper understanding, improves the ability to discriminate between different problem types, and enhances the transfer of learning to new contexts. It feels harder initially but leads to better long-term results. Application for Programmers: Instead of doing 20 Python loop problems, then 20 Python conditional problems, mix them up. If learning web development, switch between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tasks within a study session. Work on different types of coding challenges that require varied approaches. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain 'Interleaving' as a study technique and contrast it with 'Blocked Practice.' I am learning basic calculus, specifically differentiation rules (power rule, product rule, quotient rule). Design a 1-hour study session plan that uses interleaving for these three rules. Generate a 3-question quiz that interleaves problems requiring these different differentiation rules. ```","title":"5. Interleaving"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/learning-how-to-learn-summary-revised2025/#6-illusions-of-competence","text":"Explanation: The feeling that you understand or have mastered material when you actually haven't. This often arises from passive review techniques. Importance: Recognizing and avoiding these illusions is crucial for effective studying. Wasting time on ineffective strategies gives a false sense of security. Common Traps: Rereading: Familiarity with the text is mistaken for understanding. Excessive Highlighting: Can be passive and gives the illusion of engagement without real learning. Looking at Solutions Too Soon: Robs you of the beneficial struggle needed to learn. Strategies to Avoid: Prioritize active recall and self-testing. Explain concepts in your own words (Feynman technique). Work problems before looking at solutions. Minimize highlighting; if used, do it sparingly and then summarize highlighted points from memory. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, define 'Illusions of Competence' in the context of learning. List three common study habits that lead to illusions of competence. For each habit, suggest an active learning strategy to counteract it and promote genuine understanding. ```","title":"6. Illusions of Competence"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/learning-how-to-learn-summary-revised2025/#7-the-power-of-sleep-in-learning","text":"Explanation: Sleep plays a critical role in learning and memory. During sleep, the brain consolidates memories (strengthening important ones, discarding less important ones), clears metabolic toxins built up during wakefulness, and rehearses and processes information learned during the day. Importance: Adequate, quality sleep is essential for forming lasting memories, gaining insights, and maintaining cognitive function. Lack of sleep impairs attention, learning capacity, and problem-solving skills. Practical Advice: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule. A brief review of material before sleep can enhance consolidation. Ensure your sleep environment is conducive to rest. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain the importance of sleep for learning and memory. Summarize the top three benefits of sleep for memory consolidation and problem-solving. Provide two practical tips for optimizing sleep when preparing for an important exam. ```","title":"7. The Power of Sleep in Learning"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/learning-how-to-learn-summary-revised2025/#8-overcoming-procrastination","text":"Explanation: Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing tasks, often due to discomfort or anxiety associated with the task. Learning, especially challenging material, can trigger this. Key Strategies: The Pomodoro Technique: Work in focused 25-minute intervals (Pomodoros) separated by short 5-minute breaks. After about 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). The key is to focus on the process (the 25 minutes of work) rather than the product (finishing the entire task), which makes starting easier. Reward yourself after completing a Pomodoro or a set of them. Process Over Product: Shift focus from the potentially overwhelming outcome to the manageable steps or time you'll invest. \"I will work on this for 25 minutes\" is less daunting than \"I will master this entire chapter.\" Managing Habits (The Habit Loop - Cue, Routine, Reward, Belief): Cue: Identify what triggers your procrastination (e.g., feeling overwhelmed, a specific time of day, a notification). Routine: The procrastination itself. Aim to change this to a productive study routine. Reward: What do you get from procrastinating (e.g., temporary relief, distraction)? Find a healthier reward for studying. Belief: Cultivate the belief that you can change your habits and succeed. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain common reasons for procrastination when studying. Describe the Pomodoro Technique in detail, including its components and benefits.

Importance: They bridge the gap between new information and existing knowledge, making difficult concepts more intuitive and memorable. How to Use: Actively try to create your own metaphors and analogies when learning something new. Relate new concepts to things you already understand well from different fields. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, explain why metaphors and analogies are powerful tools for learning. I am trying to understand how a 'Virtual Private Network (VPN)' works. Generate two different analogies to help a beginner grasp this concept. Suggest a process for creating personal metaphors when learning a new technical term. ```","title":"9. Metaphors and Analogies"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/learning-how-to-learn-summary-revised2025/#10-growth-mindset-vs-fixed-mindset","text":"Explanation: Fixed Mindset: The belief that abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits \u2013 you either have them or you don't. Growth Mindset: The belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed over time through dedication, effort, effective strategies, and learning from mistakes. Importance: A growth mindset fosters resilience, a willingness to embrace challenges, persistence in the face of setbacks, and a greater likelihood of achieving potential. It's foundational to effective learning. Cultivating a Growth Mindset: Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. View effort as the path to mastery. Learn from criticism and feedback. Persist despite setbacks; see failure as a learning opportunity. Be inspired by the success of others. AI Prompt Example: ``` ChatGPT, define 'Growth Mindset' and 'Fixed Mindset.'

Then I can directly ask for anki cards, outlines, and quizzes for specific chunks and other techniques. Key Takeaways Can you provide the key points of the book \"learning how to learn\" I'm sorry for any confusion, but as of my last training cut-off in September 2021, there is no book titled \"Learning How to Learn\". However, there is a popular online course with the same title offered by Coursera, taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. This course provides key insights into the learning process, based on scientific research. Here are some key takeaways from the course, which could also be presented as principles in a hypothetical \"Learning How to Learn\" book: Focused and Diffuse Modes of Thinking : Our brain operates in two modes. The focused mode involves a direct approach to solving problems using logical, sequential, analytical thought. The diffuse mode is more relaxed and is associated with \"big-picture\" thinking. Both modes are necessary for learning. Active Recall and Spaced Repetition : Repeatedly testing oneself and recalling information over spaced intervals are effective techniques for strengthening memory. This is often more effective than simply rereading or highlighting text. Chunking : This involves breaking down complex information into smaller, manageable chunks. Over time, these chunks can be linked together to understand and recall large amounts of information. Procrastination and Memory : The course discusses the science of procrastination and suggests methods to overcome it, such as the Pomodoro Technique (working for 25 minutes, then taking a five-minute break). It also delves into how sleep affects memory and why it's crucial for learning. Interleaving : This technique involves mixing different types of problems or learning materials in one study session. This contrasts with blocked practice (doing a lot of the same type of problem at once), and it's generally more effective for long-term learning. Metaphors and Analogies : These can help in understanding and remembering difficult concepts by linking new information to something you already know. Mindset : The course emphasizes the importance of a \"growth mindset\", the belief that intelligence and talent can be developed over time through effort, as opposed to a \"fixed mindset\", the belief that these qualities are inborn and unchangeable. This is just a summary, and the course goes into much more detail about the science behind these principles and how to apply them effectively. For a comprehensive understanding, I'd recommend either taking the course or reading a book that elaborates on these principles. Dr. Barbara Oakley also has a book called \"A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)\" which talks about similar concepts in the context of learning math and science. Chunking Can you provide a practical outline tot ry chunking and also an outline for interleaving? I am a programmer if that context helps. Absolutely, chunking and interleaving can be extremely beneficial techniques for learning programming. Here's how you can apply them: Chunking Chunking refers to the process of breaking down larger pieces of information into smaller, manageable \"chunks\". In the context of programming, these chunks could be individual skills, concepts, or sections of code. Identify a Topic or Task : Start by identifying what you need to learn. For example, if you are learning a new programming language or framework, the whole topic might seem overwhelming at first. Break It Down : Next, break this topic down into smaller, manageable parts or \"chunks\". These could be individual functions, classes, or methods in the language or framework you're trying to learn. Focus on One Chunk : Concentrate on learning one chunk at a time. For instance, if you're learning Python, you might start with basic syntax, then move on to data types, and then to control flow structures like loops and conditionals. Practice and Repeat : After you've understood one chunk, practice it. Write code using the function or feature you've just learned. Repeat this process until you feel comfortable with it. Link Chunks : Once you're comfortable with individual chunks, start linking them together. Write code that uses multiple functions or features that you've learned. This will help you understand how these chunks fit together to create a larger program. Interleaving Interleaving involves switching between different types of problems or learning materials in one study session. In programming, this could mean working on different types of coding tasks or switching between different coding languages or concepts. Identify Different Topics or Tasks : Just like with chunking, start by identifying what you need to learn. Then, find several different types of tasks or topics within this larger topic. Mix Your Practice : Instead of practicing one type of task or topic until you've mastered it (which is called \"blocked practice\"), mix up your practice. Work on one type of task for a while, then switch to a different type. Apply to Different Contexts : For instance, if you are learning web development, you could practice JavaScript for a while, then switch to CSS, and then to HTML. This will help you understand how these different languages work together to create a website. Use Different Resources : Use a mix of tutorials, documentation, and practical projects. This way, you are not only switching between different topics but also between different learning modalities. Revisit Previous Topics : Regularly revisit previously learned concepts and try to apply them to new problems. This helps strengthen your understanding and enhance recall. Remember that both chunking and interleaving should be combined with active recall (practicing retrieving information or performing a task) and spaced repetition (revisiting information after increasing intervals of time) for effective learning.","title":"Learning How To Learn Summary"},{"location":"docs/llm_generated/learning-how-to-learn-summary/#learning-how-to-learn","text":"I would like to condense this to a format for chatgpt to provide information.

Similarities between the two both kept creative/work journals journals veered off without warning, to whatever comes to the author's focus, not trying for a structure, but just freely journaling. More Techniques This is pretty useful, putting the excerpt here: More techniques Here are some other techniques people use to access and maintain the zone: Introducing a long delay between when you do the work and when it is shown to the world. Annie Ernaux writes about this in A Simple Passion, a memoir about how she becomes obsessed in a banal way with a man who is having an affair with her\u2014the thought that others will read these notes about the tacky sex life of a middle-aged woman feels, to her, almost fictional. She will be far away when it happens. Therefore, she doesn\u2019t feel a need to protect herself. Thinking of the work in religious terms, as a service to, or a search for, God. Bergman, Grothendieck, and Pascal all do this. It might be easier to summon the awe and daring necessary to push out into the unknown and against social pressure if the alternative is failing God. Or a fiendish muse. Working with talented and open-minded collaborators, if you have the chance, can be a way to enter the zone. Nick Cave, when asked how he\u2019s been able to reinvent himself so many times as a musician, says that his bandmates, especially Warren Ellis, simply will not play anything that sounds like what he\u2019s done before. He has surrounded himself with people whose influence is the inverse of the social pressure of normal society and his audience. Another idea if you want to push against the mental pressure that kills good ideas, from Paul Graham\u2019s recent essay on how to do good work: \u201cOne way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for someone else to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.\u201d I don\u2019t know of anyone using this technique, but it might work. Actively subvert expectations. Kristian Mattsson, who performs under the moniker Tallest Man on Earth, says he pays close attention to his emotions as he\u2019s writing new songs. If he gets excited, purely, he immediately puts the guitar down\u2014excitement means what he is playing something he knows others will like, something that retreads paths he has already explored and been socially validated for. The songs he\u2019s looking for are the ones that he\u2019s ashamed of liking. Noticing these subtle differences in creative excitement requires subtle introspection. But you can be even more subtle. If we think of creative introspection as having three levels, Mattsson is on level two. (Level one is just noticing that you find an idea interesting or exciting.) Level two is noticing that your longing to be accepted can fool you to get excited about an idea that you are not actually excited about. Level three is Andrei Tarkovsky. In his diary, during preproduction of his masterpiece Solaris, the Soviet filmmaker writes that he has met a sound engineer that he considers brilliant. The sound engineer told Tarkovsky that they shouldn\u2019t use Bach in the film because \u201ceveryone is using Bach in their films at the moment.\u201d In the diary, Tarkovsky makes no further note, but in the film, the music is\u2014Bach. Tarkovsky realized it didn\u2019t matter that Bach was a popular choice that people would praise him for. It was just the right thing. This is very hard to do, so most creatives stay on level 2 and learn that what is popular is a trap. This does lead to good ideas being needlessly killed. But likely more would die if they had let what is popular kill unpopular ideas. Work so fast that you don\u2019t have time to self-censor. While writing the intensely confessional My Struggle, Knausgaard forced himself to write five pages a day to overcome his tendency to freeze up in shame. Every time he acclimated to the pace of his writing, he increased the quota so he would always be overwhelmed\u2014at one point he forced himself to write 25,000 words in 24 hours, about a third of a normal-sized novel. It is not the best writing he has done; it kind of melts at the edges. But it is true literature and, like R\u00e9coltes et Semailles and Bergman\u2019s workbooks, it is a rare opportunity to observe an uncommon and fertile mind in real-time. The mental states where new ideas can be born are hard to open up. And they are continually collapsing. The things you have to do to keep them from caving in will make people frown upon you\u2014your tendency for isolation, working deep in the night, breaking norms. The zone is a place at the margin of society. But strangely enough, this fragile margin is where the ideas that make our society possible come from. Almost everything that makes up our world first appeared in a solitary head\u2014the innovations, the tools, the images, the stories, the prophecies, and religions\u2014it did not come from the center, it came from those who ran from it.

Annie Ernaux writes about this in A Simple Passion, a memoir about how she becomes obsessed in a banal way with a man who is having an affair with her\u2014the thought that others will read these notes about the tacky sex life of a middle-aged woman feels, to her, almost fictional. She will be far away when it happens. Therefore, she doesn\u2019t feel a need to protect herself. Thinking of the work in religious terms, as a service to, or a search for, God. Bergman, Grothendieck, and Pascal all do this. It might be easier to summon the awe and daring necessary to push out into the unknown and against social pressure if the alternative is failing God. Or a fiendish muse. Working with talented and open-minded collaborators, if you have the chance, can be a way to enter the zone. Nick Cave, when asked how he\u2019s been able to reinvent himself so many times as a musician, says that his bandmates, especially Warren Ellis, simply will not play anything that sounds like what he\u2019s done before.

DIY NAS best deal was 80gb per dollar, seagate was the cheapest brand on ebay and had reads/writes. However, the 18TB shucked drives are only $170 (provided they are not SMR), which are the same price... Linux recommends used, i guess to save on electronic waste? Shingled Drives / SMR Do not use random consumer drives for RAID arrays... ;( Check out the SMR section here for understanding what drives don't use it lately: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/wiki/hardware The exact easystore shucked drive, post 2019 WD Red drives, are shingled/SMR. According to this thread, that is not true for larger drives, they converge on helium filled: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/wlingk/should_i_buy_cmr_or_smr/ However, shucking can require power pin reroute, which I don't want to mess with. For occasional backups and cold storage, SMR is perfectly fine. In my experience, WD SMR is implemented much better than Seagate. But for WD 8-20TB are all CMR. Seagate 10-20TB are CMR. ref: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Linux_Raid ref 2: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Timeout_Mismatch In 2019, a new technology called shingled magnetic recording (SMR) started becoming mainstream. Whereas drive usage limits on conventional drives are advisory, burst limits especially on SMR drives are mandatory, and interfere with raid operation. While all manufacturers have been quietly introducing SMR on their desktop lines, WD unfortunately also introduced it on their \"suitable for NAS/RAID\" WD Red drives. Unfortunately, combining SMR and RAID is not a good idea, with many reports of new WD Reds simply refusing to be added to an existing array. While conventional desktop drives (which use conventional magnetic recording or CMR) may take up to two minutes to give up reading, SMR drives are even worse - there are reports of them stalling for over 10 minutes as the drive shuffles everything around to make space.

If you want to include the two extra checks in your choice making, simply take your salary after tax and divide it by 12. Figuring tax is annoying but you can figure it from your paycheck by taking your hourly earnings * hours and subtracting what you were actually paid.

You use your bmr to determine how many calories you can eat. There is a variance of 25% between individuals so you basically MUST build an empirical baseline for yourself. Start at the low end of your calorie intake for a few weeks, then slightly adjust to achieve your ideal weight loss based on calorie expense. You should lose 1-2 lbs, but more importantly, that should be pretty consistent each week (aka NOT 1.2 lb then 1.8 lb then back to 1.2 lb). How many calories do I burn in a day? Calorimetry Device Online BMR tests with rigid formulas are not the most accurate method of determining an individual's BMR. It is better to consult a certified specialist or measure BMR through a calorimetry device. These handheld devices are available in many health and fitness clubs, doctor offices, and weight-loss clinics. \"Do Hand-held Calorimeters Have a Role in Assessment of Nutrition Needs in Hospitalized Patients? A Systematic Review of Literature\" Results from a hand-held calorimeter were similar to those obtained from metabolic cart studies. The Douglas bag method compared to the MedGem indicated a significant agreement with a p=0.286. The hand-held device compared to metabolic carts in 9 studies with mixed results. The predictive equations (Harris-Benedict, Mifflin St. Joer and FAO/WHO equations) were found to over and underestimate RMR compared to the MedGem. The Harris-Benedict was found to overestimate the RMR by 3-11%, the Mifflin St Joer equation overestimated the RMR by 1% and the FAO/WHO equation overestimated RMR by 12%. Total energy expenditure (TEE) consists of three major components: basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermogenic effect of food, and the effect of physical activity or exercise.1 Basal metabolic rate is defined as the measurement of resting energy expenditure under the following conditions: a state of complete rest, ambient temperature is between 68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0 Fahrenheit. The subject is tested immediately upon waking after a minimum of a four hour sleep and in a post-absorptive state (12 hours after a meal). Thermogenic effect of food refers to the heat the body generates as food is digested. Physical activity is any activity in which work is performed which results in an increase in metabolic rate. Resting metabolic rate (RMR), which is synonymous with resting energy expenditure (REE), is not measured under basal conditions. It is a measurement taken during a fast (two to four hours after a meal) and allows for some movement with a rest period prior to testing.1,2 The RMR is usually higher than the BMR due to less restrictive conditions for measureing RMR. Therefore, basal metabolic rate accounts for 60- 75% 1 of TEE while RMR accounts for 50-70% of TEE.. Since the difference between BMR and RMR is only about 10%, it is more practical to measure RMR in a clinical setting.2 In clinical settings RMR is used to determine accurate energy expenditure of a patient's caloric needs. Resting metabolic rate can be measured either directly or indirectly. trent: the medgem seems fine until you have any deviation from normal including old age - see the details inside the study... Harris-Benedict Formula Calculator.net Calculations Muscle Mass \u2013 Aerobic exercise such as running or cycling has no effect on BMR. However, anaerobic exercise, such as weight-lifting, indirectly leads to a higher BMR because it builds muscle mass, increasing resting energy consumption.

It may also be EVEN LOWER for you than the calculations, it's just an AVERAGE, so DON'T reach this heart rate. But reaching your MAXIMUM HEART RATE\u2014the greatest number of beats per minute your heart can possibly achieve during exercise\u2014requires an all-out effort that is extremely uncomfortable and impossible to maintain; even the most highly trained athletes can only maintain this intensity for a few minutes at a time. In addition, exercising at or near your maximum heart rate has not been shown to have significant benefits. In fact, it can actually be risky because of the stress it puts on your heart. (1) Reserve Heart Rate You can get a more accurate picture by using the 'reserve heart rate' method from The Mayo Clinic . Your reserve heart rate is: Maximum Heart Rate - Resting Heart Rate Get your resting heart rate Get a stopwatch (try on your phone) \"Rest\" for a few moments. Put your finger on your pulse (I use my neck) Start the timer on a beat, and count beats for 60 seconds. The number of beats per 60 seconds is your resting heart rate. \"The American Heart Association recommends checking your resting heart rate first thing in the morning (but before you get out of bed.\" 1 Target Heart Rate Range Your Target Heart Rate (THR) Range is generally 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate, although it is based on you individually and there are a few ways to calculate it. IMPORTANT: There's no evidence that being at the high or low range of your Target Heart Rate is better... By knowing your TARGET HEART RATE you assure yourself that you optimize fitness improvement, calorie- and fat-burning, and you prevent overdoing it and not having fun during exercise. (1) How to improve at cardio There is no reason to push your heart rate beyond the target range during non-competitive exercise. It is bad to go too close to the max at any time. Going above your Target Heart Rate Range increases risk of damage. If you want to push yourself then: increase the TIME you are at your target heart rate. Calculate Target Heart Rate Range: Reserve Heart Rate Method This method takes into account age and base heart rate. The method is from the Mayo Clinic . Lets check target at some regular ages assuming 65 BPM Resting Heart Rate (RHR). 20 YRS : (220-20-65)*.7+65 to (220-20-65)*.85+65 = 160-180 30 YRS : (220-30-65)*.7+65 to (220-30-65)*.85+65 = 153-171 40 YRS : (220-40-65)*.7+65 to (220-40-65)*.85+65 = 146-163 50 YRS : (220-50-65)*.7+65 to (220-50-65)*.85+65 = 139-154 60 YRS : (220-60-65)*.7+65 to (220-60-65)*.85+65 = 132-146 70 YRS : (220-70-65)*.7+65 to (220-70-65)*.85+65 = 125-137 80 YRS : (220-80-65)*.7+65 to (220-80-65)*.85+65 = 118-129 Lets also check with a heart rate of 80 BPM. Note that a high heart rate increases all cause mortality, and you should seek to have a heart rate between 60-75 through physical fitness I don't love this one because it recommends people with higher resting heart rates need to reach a higher Target Heart Rate. I think this comes from lack of fitness, so it's sort of crummy advice to tell someone out of shape they need to work harder. But the range is pretty close between both. My heart rate is very stable at my level of exertion at the gym, so each individual can figure out their comfortable level on a per-machine basis. 20 YRS : (220-20-80)*.7+80 to (220-20-80)*.85+80 = 164-182 30 YRS : (220-30-80)*.7+80 to (220-30-80)*.85+80 = 157-174 40 YRS : (220-40-80)*.7+80 to (220-40-80)*.85+80 = 150-165 50 YRS : (220-50-80)*.7+80 to (220-50-80)*.85+80 = 143-157 60 YRS : (220-60-80)*.7+80 to (220-60-80)*.85+80 = 136-148 70 YRS : (220-70-80)*.7+80 to (220-70-80)*.85+80 = 129-140 80 YRS : (220-80-80)*.7+80 to (220-80-80)*.85+80 = 122-131 Max Heart Rate @ 34 Years: 220 - 34 = 186 BPM - WARNING - DO NOT GET NEAR THIS HEART RATE WARNING: This heart rate is your absolute MAXIMUM and could cause damage. It may also be EVEN LOWER for you, it's just an AVERAGE. Reserve Heart Rate (HRR) @ 34 years (MHR-HRR): 186 - 66 = 120 BPM This is how much you have \"left over\" between your resting and your max. Target Heart rate is approximately 70%-85% of Max Heart Rate, based on HRR: (186-66) * (70% to 85%) + 66 = 150 - 168 BPM The exact calculation is HRR * (70% to 85%) + RHR = THR Range Think of it as using 70-85% of your reserve This is the range for an intense workout I currently like to switch between 70% to 85% every 5 min for 25 min, this gives me some recovery. I tend to stick closer to 146 right now, I consider 154 to be a really heavy workout. I hit this something like 8 minutes into the workout? I measure what is a comfortable and natural ramp. Minimum Exercise Heart Rate is 60% of Max Heart Rate: 186 * 60% = 112 bpm I easily hit this and warm up quite comfortably to 120 BPM within a few minutes I think this is too low, but it is for mild exercise at 150 minutes per week If I did moderate exercise I would do 150 mins per week, or 50 minutes per session at 120 BPM. Calculate Target Heart Rate Range: with General Method This method takes into account age only and NOT resting heart rate. Lets check target against the resting method at some regular ages. These ranges are a lot broader and don't go nearly as high. 20 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 140-170 30 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 133-162 40 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 126-153 50 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 119-145 60 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 112-136 70 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 105-128 80 YRS : (220-20)*.7 to (220-20)*.85 = 98-119 Max Heart Rate @ 34 Years: 220 - 34 = 186 BPM - WARNING - DO NOT GET NEAR THIS HEART RATE WARNING: This heart rate is your absolute MAXIMUM and could cause damage.

I like to alternate every 5 min for 25 min. I hit this something like 8 minutes into the workout? Measure what is a comfortable and natural ramp. Minimum Exercise Heart Rate is 60% of Max Heart Rate: 186 * 60% = 112 bpm I easily hit this and warm out quite comfortably to 120 BPM within a few minutes Intensity and Time Span Summary: 150 min moderate exercise or 75 min vigorous exercise per week. Use the Rating of Perceived Exertion or 'borg' scale. Intensity You can use relative intensity to measure your workout. You are the judge of the intensity in this system. You probably need some experience to make this accurate. The primary scale has two names: Borg Scale and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale . Wikipedia: Borg Scale CDC: Measuring Exertion A rating of 12-13 probably is a moderate physical exercise?? A rating of 15-17 probably is a vigorous physical exercise?? Studies show that your perceived exertion compares well with your heart rate. So if you think you're working hard, your heart rate is probably higher than usual.

I think this comes from lack of fitness, so it's sort of crummy advice to tell someone out of shape they need to work harder. But the range is pretty close between both.

You can see your registers by typing reg in the ex prompt. It looks like this: :reg . How to use Macro Templates Macro Templates are not special features, they are simply lines of text you have stored to put back into a register for use as a macro. You could store a file where some lines are macro templates and others have comments. For example, you might paste an existing register, l , with \"lp . Methods for Copying Macros A macro doesn't really exist in vim, it's really a register, e.g. register l that is played back with the macro key, @ , e.g. @l .

While both paths involve building technology solutions, their approaches to growth, risk management, and value creation diverge significantly. This report analyzes the distinctions between small tech companies generating \u2265$50,000/month and typical solo developer ventures, while providing a roadmap for adopting an entrepreneurial framework within solo constraints. Core Focus Areas of High-Revenue Small Tech Companies 1. Scalable Systems Over Individual Output Successful small tech firms prioritize process automation and repeatable workflows rather than relying on individual heroics. For example, companies like Pixelixe.com achieved growth by implementing CI/CD pipelines, automated customer onboarding sequences, and AI-driven support systems[10]. This contrasts with solo developers who often manually handle tasks like deployment and client communication. 2. Market Validation Through Data Top-performing tech startups allocate 20-30% of resources to quantitative market analysis . Tools like Hotjar heatmaps, A/B testing frameworks, and cohort analysis drive product decisions\u2014a practice rarely systematized by solo developers working intuition-first[10][14]. One study showed startups using Mixpanel analytics achieved 2.1x faster revenue growth than those relying on gut-feel decisions[8]. 3. Strategic Outsourcing While maintaining core IP in-house, successful small companies outsource 40-60% of non-critical functions. A survey of 150 $50k+/month SaaS businesses revealed: - 73% outsourced UI/UX design - 68% used freelance content marketers - 52% contracted DevOps specialists[10][13] This contrasts with solo developers attempting to handle all roles themselves. Typical Solo Developer Limitations 1. Skill Siloing Solo developers often spread effort across frontend/backend, marketing, and ops\u2014leading to 67% slower feature deployment compared to specialized teams[9]. The average solo app takes 14.2 months to reach MVP versus 8.3 months for small teams[8]. 2. Revenue Model Constraints Most solo ventures rely on: - Upfront app purchases (39% market share) - Basic ad networks like AdMob (52%) - Limited subscription tiers[1][14] In contrast, successful small companies deploy hybrid models combining usage-based pricing, enterprise plans, and API monetization\u2014generating 2.4x higher ARPU[10]. 3. Growth Ceiling Analysis of 2,300 solo apps shows: - Median monthly revenue: $1,200 - Top 5% achieving $12,000/month - 0.7% reaching $50k+[13][14] This contrasts with small team-led startups where 18% surpass $50k/month within 24 months[8]. Adopting the Entrepreneurial Mindset as a Solo Developer 1. Product-Market Fit Engineering Replace \"build it and they will come\" with systematic validation: - Conduct problem interviews with 50+ target users before coding - Use no-code tools like Figma/Webflow for rapid prototype testing - Implement Pirate Metrics (AARRR) from day one[11][14] The founder of EDM Hunters validated music discovery pain points through Reddit communities before development[3]. 2. Automation-First Development Leverage AI/cloud tools to simulate team capabilities: # Example AI-driven user feedback analysis from openai import OpenAI import pandas as pd client = OpenAI () def analyze_feedback ( feedback_list ): insights = [] for text in feedback_list : response = client . chat . completions . create ( model = \"gpt-4\" , messages = [{ \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : f \"Extract key pain points from: { text } \" }] ) insights . append ( response . choices [ 0 ] . message . content ) return pd . DataFrame ( insights ) This approach helped Dawson Botsford's crypto app handle 10k+ users with minimal manual effort[4]. 3. Strategic Monetization Stacking Combine revenue streams to mimic corporate income diversity: | Layer | Solo Implementation | Revenue Potential | |--------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------| | Core Product | Premium subscription ($9.99-$19.99/month) | 45% of total | | API Access | Stripe-integrated developer API ($0.01/req) | 30% | | Data Products| Anonymized usage analytics (Snowflake marketplace) | 15% | | Affiliate | Tool integrations (e.g., AWS credits) | 10% | The meditation app Medito achieved $58k/month through similar stacking despite being solo-built[14]. Critical Mindset Shifts 1. Risk Management vs. Risk Avoidance Entrepreneurs view risk as calculated investment: - Allocate 15% revenue to growth experiments - Maintain 6-month financial runway - Use LLC structures for liability protection[7][11] Solo developers often avoid risks completely, stagnating growth. 2. Value Network Building Top performers cultivate: - Advisory boards (2-3 industry veterans) - Mastermind groups (5-7 non-competing founders) - Strategic partnerships (e.g., app cross-promotions) The solo founder behind Cleanup: Phone Storage Cleaner attributes 38% of user growth to partnership integrations[6]. 3. Institutional Knowledge Capture Implement systems preserving operational knowledge: - Notion wikis for processes - Loom video SOPs - Automated documentation generators This enables scaling beyond personal bandwidth constraints[10][14]. Conclusion: The Hybrid Solo-Entrepreneur Framework Achieving small-company results as a solo developer requires adopting corporate-grade systems while maintaining individual agility . Key implementation steps: Productize Services Convert custom work into standardized SaaS offerings using platforms like Bubble.io. Build Growth Loops Implement referral programs offering 30-day free trials for invites. Leverage AI Co-Pilots Deploy tools like GitHub Copilot (68% code completion rate) and Jasper.ai (200% content output increase). Strategic Outsourcing Allocate 20-30% of revenue to vetted freelancers via Upwork/Toptal. Case studies show solo developers using this framework reach $50k/month within 18-24 months\u2014comparable to small team timelines[10][14]. The path demands ruthless prioritization and system thinking, but proves entrepreneurial results need not require corporate-scale resources. By blending corporate rigor with solo agility, developers can transcend traditional limitations while preserving creative autonomy.

These tools can help you manage subscriptions, analytics, paywalls, and other aspects of app development more efficiently. Tools and Services to Accelerate SwiftUI App Development 1. Subscription and In-App Purchase Management These tools simplify the implementation of subscriptions and in-app purchases: RevenueCat : Handles in-app purchases and subscriptions with server-side receipt validation. Provides advanced analytics (e.g., churn, MRR) and paywall optimization. Great for cross-app and cross-platform subscription sharing. Cost: Free for apps earning <$2,500/month; 1% of revenue above that. StoreKit (Native) : Apple's native framework for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions. Use SubscriptionStoreView and ProductView introduced in recent SwiftUI updates for easier integration. Requires manual receipt validation if no backend is used. Qonversion : An alternative to RevenueCat for subscription management with a focus on analytics. Includes A/B testing for paywalls and integrations with marketing tools. 2. Paywall Design and Optimization Paywalls are critical for subscription-based apps. These tools help you design and optimize them: Adapty : Offers pre-built paywall templates that can be customized without app updates. Includes A/B testing capabilities for paywall designs. Tracks conversion rates and user behavior. Superwall : A no-code solution to create dynamic paywalls that adapt based on user behavior. Allows real-time updates without requiring app resubmissions. 3. Analytics and User Insights Understanding user behavior is key to improving your app's performance: Firebase Analytics : Free tool from Google for tracking user engagement, retention, and events. Integrates easily with SwiftUI apps via Swift Package Manager. Mixpanel : Offers advanced analytics for user behavior tracking, retention analysis, and funnel optimization. Useful for apps with complex user flows or multiple subscription tiers. Amplitude : Focuses on product analytics, helping you understand how users interact with your app features. Includes cohort analysis to track user retention over time. 4. Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) If you need a backend to manage data or subscriptions: Firebase : Provides a real-time database, Firestore (NoSQL), authentication services, and push notifications. Great for small-to-medium apps that need quick backend solutions. Supabase : Open-source alternative to Firebase with PostgreSQL as the database backend. Includes authentication, storage, and serverless functions. 5. UI/UX Components Pre-built UI libraries can save significant time when designing your app: SwiftUIX : Extends SwiftUI by adding missing components like text views, activity indicators, and more. Lottie by Airbnb : Use JSON-based animations in your SwiftUI app for engaging UI effects. Hero Animations Library : Simplifies complex view transitions in SwiftUI or UIKit apps. 6. Testing Tools Ensure your app is bug-free with these testing tools: XCTest (Native) : Apple's built-in framework for unit testing and UI testing. TestFlight (Native) : Distribute beta versions of your app to testers directly through App Store Connect. Figma Mirror App : Test UI designs on real devices before coding them into SwiftUI. 7. Monetization Beyond Subscriptions If you're monetizing beyond subscriptions, consider these services: Google AdMob : Integrates ads into your app using UIViewControllerRepresentable in SwiftUI. Unity Ads : Focused on rewarded video ads, ideal for gaming or interactive apps. Summary Table Category Tools/Services Purpose Subscription Management RevenueCat, Qonversion, StoreKit Simplify subscription handling across multiple apps or platforms. Paywall Design Adapty, Superwall Create customizable paywalls with A/B testing capabilities. Analytics Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude Track user behavior, retention rates, and conversion metrics. Backend Firebase, Supabase Manage data storage, authentication, push notifications without building custom servers. UI/UX Components SwiftUIX, Lottie Animations Add missing UI components or animations easily. Testing XCTest (Native), TestFlight Ensure smooth functionality through rigorous testing workflows. Monetization Google AdMob, Unity Ads Add ads as an additional revenue stream. By combining these tools with SwiftUI's declarative framework and Apple's native solutions like StoreKit or TestFlight, you can significantly accelerate development while maintaining high-quality standards.

Compound weightlifting stuff, organize this better squats, deadlifts, i have like 8 others I am interested in, and whatever else too Lose 8 lbs, be at 8% body fat. Current target wt. 190.3 lbs. straightforwards: just 8 weeks of my current cardio/lifting without any cheeseburgers or pizza. I don't need to calorie count based on the low importance of the 8 week timeline. Develop a good routine: Dynamic Warmups before exercise, static stretching after exercise Improve balance in each leg and between legs, half ball stuff, what else? Mobility improve range of motion in shoulders and arms Determine needs for hip mobility general tips really feel and hold the squeeze at the top use a slow negative/eccentric too, 3 seconds up, pause and flex the muscle 2 seconds, 3 seconds down Questions: How often should I foam roll? I don't want to do it like... 6 hours a week... my guess: more is better, watch TV and foam roll like every other day what is the squat case in which I can somehow put strain or sliding on the knees? Maybe it isn't one of my problems? how can i improve mobility to get a bit deeper into my squat? what works the anterior deltoids on the two arm seated cable pull out of A I Y T? Do I have anything in my workouts that works the anterior deltoids? how does holding the squeeze go for say a curl, should i pause halfway down in the eccentric? how do i pause and flex \"at the top\" (or wherever) in other exercises than a pushup? how do you use the 2 lacrosse balls taped together? any more lacrosse ball tips? Body Composition Machine Nothing notable, 11.1% body fat. I think recommended is 10%-20% and minimum acceptable is about 6%. Based on this I don't need to lose any weight and can really only lose 21.9 - (198.3*.06) == 10.0 lbs BUT - all body fat loss is good for my cholesterol, so maybe I will aim for a 7-8% body fat. In this case, lose 21.9 - (198.3*.07) == 8 lbs. Target weight: 190.3 lbs Squats Squat Form to get the leg form, clench your butt and feel the tension pushing your outside feet into the ground and your outside legs flexingand your hips widening outwards knees should be above toes, going straight down squat should be wide, toes might be slightly out, it's based on body type low position is femurs parallel to the ground go straight down, don't tip forwards squat facing and up against the mirror to prevent leaning forwards i didn't do this, but may in the future i didn't tip back when i was holding a ~20 lbs kettlebell upside down and squatting with that if i just do a bunch of squats, will i stop tipping back as I get more stability? when going up activate the glutes A LOT breathing: inhale before going down, part of the way up, start your exhale, queston: is this related to the glute activation time? i will get a feel for it... Squat Stability Two leg squat stability stand on the half ball and squat, hold something for support ensure your feet are even forward and back ball is more advanced, you can also use the big black cube things Single Leg squat Stability stability exercise: stand on the half ball with one foot in the dead center move your other foot in front, then to the side, then back this is not exaggerated, just a few inches on each one, rotate between front, parallel, back, parallel, front, etc. maybe do this 10 times stability is a constant importance, even a 350 lbs squat was able to get to 420 by doing like 100 squats on a half ball muscle imbalance shows up as the fast rocking back and forth on the half ball Pushup Stability pushups on the half ball, don't grip the outsides, keep your hands flat we did this for 5 minutes, I had good pushup stability this was still a great exercise and I should repeat it 3 seconds down, 3 seconds up, 2 second flex at the top flex your muscles manually at the top for 2 seconds this manual activation will improve the burn even stop halfway down and hold it \"time in position\" or something? basically you hold it, that will give a good workout more strengthening in the negative of the weightlifting also pause/hold movement in tension for 2 seconds, e.g. halfway down Two arm seated cable pull Goal: Work the A and I positions into my back and core day, maybe move core day to leg day? Shoulder Mobility, 4 positions: A, I, Y, T I do a 30 deg. bench dumbbell reverse fly in the T and Y positions I felt very weak in the A position, both arms straight pulling down alongside my hips I used the minimum weight didn't really feel the activation much below my shoulderblades need to work this a lot to get these muscles going I felt weaker in the I position, both arms overhead, need to work on this too Broom Handle I should get a broom handle for my house, as this doesn't need to be done in the gym and probably needs done daily. Shoulder mobility find the minimum width where you can very smoothly clear the broom handle from in front of your hips to behind your hips the whole exercise should be smooth, going from front to back, then back to front keep the bar as far away from your body as you can throughout repeat it 15 times or something This is very wide for me, and I should be able to reduce the distance between my hands over time by doing this daily Planks Hold 12\" ball between the elbow and the knee, then hold the opposite leg and arm up and out, at kind of a 45 degree angle Elbow plank should be called \"forearm plank\" keep the weight distributed on my forearms, avoid lots on the elbows. keep the shoulders over the forearms keep a strong stance throughout, try not to sag 4 x 90 second plank is a good benchmark, get it in i don't think elbow should be harder than hand? Foam rolling Tools: foam roller (hard), lacrosse ball Rolling is a misnomer, it should be foam pressing or something. You only roll to find the spot, then you hold it there. lacrosse ball is great, you can go pretty hard, but don't go too hard put a string on a lacrosse ball for using against the wall tape 2 lacrosse balls together for the legs, not sure why You don't need to wait until you are tight to do this, do it early and do it often. Keep the pressure until you feel the release. positions: between the hip flare bone and the hip bone there are muscles that fan out, whatever those are anterior to the fan out is the hip flexor posterior to the fan out is something that needs it too similar to pidgeon to get the muscle outside of the shin - i definitely feel this calves etc classic leg foam rolling, i have done this a hundred times, hit the IT band, anywhere you can feel it, do it unti you get the release Dynamic warmups Dynamic warmup before exercise, static stretching after exercise/cardio (end of workout) For tomorrow: Alternatingly 25x - stand on one foot and sweep my arms up, sort of like a partial squat in the hips and knee. Switch feet each time.","title":"20230724 Training"},{"location":"docs/praxes/training/20230724_training/#personal-training-20230724","text":"","title":"Personal Training 20230724"},{"location":"docs/praxes/training/20230724_training/#goal-ideas","text":"This is just a rough scratchpad.

Learning on your own is extremely effective for deep knowledge. Improve independent thinking. Many exceptionally successful people dropped out of college (although the examples generally had immediate financial incentives to leave and stable family wealth). I think the point still stands since they learned what they needed to before college, then became hyper focused on a separate incentive set, even with backup opportunities. For learning, Persistence is more important than Intelligence. People will undermine you. Competition can get dirty and is as common as cooperation. Practice maintaining a cool composure. Great teachers create a great environment for learning... TODO what were the key points here? Some people figure out their learning style then emphasize that. For example, the surgeon who emphasized books over his classes because he learned better that way. I learn very very well from books as well. They are like a direct discussion with the author to me, although obviously I have to use other avenues if I can't ask myself and discover the answer. Use teachers' time wisely. Avoid seeking an ego boost through communication with them. Avoid trying to prove why your convoluted answer is right and learn it their way first, then you can go back to messing with your convoluted way to see if it has merit (generally will not).

Knuth explains that $2.56, or 256 cents, corresponds to one hexadecimal dollar.[8] \"Valuable suggestions\" are worth 32 cents, or about \u200a1\u20448 of the errors in the book (0.001 hexadecimal dollars or 0.1 hexadecimal cents).

This also enables some language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options. Macros (source) A macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro. There are two kinds of macros. They differ mostly in what they look like when they are used. Object-like macros resemble data objects when used, function-like macros resemble function calls. You may define any valid identifier as a macro, even if it is a C keyword. The preprocessor does not know anything about keywords. This can be useful if you wish to hide a keyword such as const from an older compiler that does not understand it. However, the preprocessor operator defined (see Defined) can never be defined as a macro, and C++'s named operators (see C++ Named Operators) cannot be macros when you are compiling C++.

Concept of safe methods Safe methods must be implemented in a safe way, beyond scope of spec Of the request methods defined by this specification, the GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE methods are defined to be safe. Request methods are considered \"safe\" if their defined semantics are essentially read-only; i.e., the client does not request, and does not expect, any state change on the origin server as a result of applying a safe method to a target resource. Likewise, reasonable use of a safe method is not expected to cause any harm, loss of property, or unusual burden on the origin server. This definition of safe methods does not prevent an implementation from including behavior that is potentially harmful, that is not entirely read-only, or that causes side effects while invoking a safe method. What is important, however, is that the client did not request that additional behavior and cannot be held accountable for it. idempotent Request methods: PUT, DELETE, safe request methods Idempotent methods are distinguished because the request can be repeated automatically if a communication failure occurs before the client is able to read the server's response.

Response Header Fields detailed index to be aware of if parsing responses HTTP Semantics - Security Considerations be aware of these, read them over rfc7232 Highlights This specification defines two forms of metadata that are commonly used to observe resource state and test for preconditions: modification dates (Section 2.2) and opaque entity tags (Section 2.3). Additional metadata that reflects resource state has been defined by various extensions of HTTP, such as Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV, [RFC4918]), that are beyond the scope of this specification. A resource metadata value is referred to as a \"validator\" when it is used within a precondition. Header Fields Defined by this RFC ETag If-Match If-Modified-Since If-None-Match If-Unmodified-Since Last-Modified Last-Modified Header Field The \"Last-Modified\" header field in a response provides a timestamp indicating the date and time at which the origin server believes the selected representation was last modified, as determined at the conclusion of handling the request. ETag == entity-tag An entity-tag can be more reliable for validation than a modification date in situations where it is inconvenient to store modification dates, where the one-second resolution of HTTP date values is not sufficient, or where modification dates are not consistently maintained. rfc7233 Highlights rfc7234 Highlights rfc7235 Highlights oauth2/bearer Authorization is covered in rfc7235 and its spec resides in rfc6750 Note that oauth2/bearer aka The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, supercedes outh rfc6749 . oauth2 Authorization headers are very common for HTTP APIs , particularly modern JSON APIs There is a IANA Authentication Scheme Registry in the References of this document. rfc7235 supercedes rfc2617 . rfc7236 Highlights This document is a sparse reference to grandfather HTTP Authentication Methods established before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was established. rfc7237 Highlights This document is a sparse reference to grandfather HTTP Methods established in RFCs other than RFC7231 before the IANA HTTP Scheme Registry was established.

ETag == entity-tag An entity-tag can be more reliable for validation than a modification date in situations where it is inconvenient to store modification dates, where the one-second resolution of HTTP date values is not sufficient, or where modification dates are not consistently maintained.","title":"rfc7232 Highlights"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#rfc7233-highlights","text":"","title":"rfc7233 Highlights"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#rfc7234-highlights","text":"","title":"rfc7234 Highlights"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#rfc7235-highlights","text":"oauth2/bearer Authorization is covered in rfc7235 and its spec resides in rfc6750 Note that oauth2/bearer aka The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, supercedes outh rfc6749 . oauth2 Authorization headers are very common for HTTP APIs , particularly modern JSON APIs There is a IANA Authentication Scheme Registry in the References of this document. rfc7235 supercedes rfc2617 .","title":"rfc7235 Highlights"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#rfc7236-highlights","text":"This document is a sparse reference to grandfather HTTP Authentication Methods established before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was established.","title":"rfc7236 Highlights"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#rfc7237-highlights","text":"This document is a sparse reference to grandfather HTTP Methods established in RFCs other than RFC7231 before the IANA HTTP Scheme Registry was established.","title":"rfc7237 Highlights"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#references","text":"IANA Authentication Scheme Registry Of note is oauth2/bearer IANA HTTP Methods Registry table contains: methods if they are safe if they are idempotent current URL to RFC describing the method (many not in rfc7230 or rfc7231 IANA Status Code Registry REST in rfc7231: references Fielding 2000 Ch. 5 REST: \"REpresentational State Transfer\" architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems","title":"References"},{"location":"docs/references/http1.1/#obsolete","text":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2145 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616","title":"Obsolete"},{"location":"docs/references/icestick_setup/","text":"Lattice Icestick Evaluation Board - Resources & Information My \"Lattice Semiconductor\" Icestick iCE40 HX1K-TQ144 \"iCEstick Evaluation Kit\" Offical Resources Documentation You must create an account with an email and login to download the software.

Key Principles Mathematical Chemistry wikipedia: Mathematical Chemistry Topology wikipedia: Topology (chemistry) In chemistry, topology provides a convenient way of describing and predicting the molecular structure within the constraints of three-dimensional (3-D) space. Given the determinants of chemical bonding and the chemical properties of the atoms, topology provides a model for explaining how the atoms ethereal wave functions must fit together. Molecular topology is a part of mathematical chemistry dealing with the algebraic description of chemical compounds so allowing a unique and easy characterization of them. Topology is insensitive to the details of a scalar field, and can often be determined using simplified calculations. Scalar fields such as electron density, Madelung field, covalent field and the electrostatic potential can be used to model topology.[1] Each scalar field has its own distinctive topology and each provides different information about the nature of chemical bonding and structure. The analysis of these topologies, when combined with simple electrostatic theory and a few empirical observations, leads to a quantitative model of localized chemical bonding. In the process, the analysis provides insights into the nature of chemical bonding. Applied topology explains how large molecules reach their final shapes and how biological molecules achieve their activity. Circuit topology is a topological property of folded linear polymers. This notion has been applied to structural analysis of biomolecules such as proteins and RNAs. Topological Index wikipedia: Topological Index In the fields of chemical graph theory, molecular topology, and mathematical chemistry, a topological index also known as a connectivity index is a type of a molecular descriptor that is calculated based on the molecular graph of a chemical compound.[1] Topological indices are numerical parameters of a graph which characterize its topology and are usually graph invariant. Topological indices are used for example in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) in which the biological activity or other properties of molecules are correlated with their chemical structure.[2] Chemical Graph Theory wikipedia: Chemical Graph Theory Chemical graph theory is the topology branch of mathematical chemistry which applies graph theory to mathematical modelling of chemical phenomena.[1] The pioneers of the chemical graph theory are Alexandru Balaban, Ante Graovac, Ivan Gutman, Haruo Hosoya, Milan Randi\u0107 and Nenad Trinajsti\u0107[2] (also Harry Wiener and others). In 1988, it was reported that several hundred researchers worked in this area producing about 500 articles annually. A number of monographs have been written in the area, including the two-volume comprehensive text by Trinajstic, Chemical Graph Theory, that summarized the field up to mid-1980s.[3] The adherents of the theory maintain that the properties of a chemical graph (i.e., a graph-theoretical representation of a molecule) give valuable insights into the chemical phenomena. The opponents contend that graphs play only a fringe role in chemical research.[4] One variant of the theory is the representation of materials as infinite Euclidean graphs, particularly crystals by periodic graphs. Cheminformatics wikipedia: Cheminformatics Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics, chemioinformatics and chemical informatics) is the use of computer and informational techniques applied to a range of problems in the field of chemistry. These in silico techniques are used, for example, in pharmaceutical companies in the process of drug discovery. These methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries in various other forms. Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry, computer science and information science for example in the areas of topology, chemical graph theory, information retrieval and data mining in the chemical space.[5][6][7][8] Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for various industries like paper and pulp, dyes and such allied industries. Chemical Space Concept: Theoretical Space vs. Concrete Space . wikipedioa: Chemical Space Chemical space is a concept in cheminformatics referring to the property space spanned by all possible molecules and chemical compounds adhering to a given set of construction principles and boundary conditions.

Since molecules may be represented by molecular graphs this is strongly related to graph mining and structured data mining. The main problem is how to represent molecules while discriminating the data instances. One way to do this is chemical similarity metrics, which has a long tradition in the field of cheminformatics. Typical approaches to calculate chemical similarities use chemical fingerprints, but this loses the underlying information about the molecule topology. Mining the molecular graphs directly avoids this problem. So does the inverse QSAR problem which is preferable for vectorial mappings. Molecular Query Language wikipedia: Molecular Query Language The Molecular Query Language (MQL) was designed to allow more complex, problem-specific search methods in chemoinformatics. In contrast to the widely used SMARTS queries, MQL provides for the specification of spatial and physicochemical properties of atoms and bonds. Additionally, it can easily be extended to handle non-atom-based graphs, also known as \"reduced feature\" graphs. The query language is based on an extended Backus\u2013Naur form (EBNF) using JavaCC. SMARTS: Smiles arbitrary target specification The article has tons of detail about SMARTS which is apparently a contrasting method to MQL (Molecular Query Language). wikipedia: Smiles arbitrary target specification SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS) is a language for specifying substructural patterns in molecules. The SMARTS line notation is expressive and allows extremely precise and transparent substructural specification and atom typing. SMARTS is related to the SMILES line notation[1] that is used to encode molecular structures and like SMILES was originally developed by David Weininger and colleagues at Daylight Chemical Information Systems. The most comprehensive descriptions of the SMARTS language can be found in Daylight's SMARTS theory manual,[2] tutorial [3] and examples.[4] OpenEye Scientific Software has developed their own version of SMARTS which differs from the original Daylight version in how the R descriptor (see cyclicity below) is defined. The standard may require updates to accommodate for new the elements named in 2016.[5] Transferability Both bond length and bond angle are transferable. The opposite of transferable is conserved e.g. standard atomic weight. From: wikipedia: Tranferability (chemistry) Transferability, in chemistry, is the assumption that a chemical property that is associated with an atom or a functional group in a molecule will have a similar (but not identical) value in a variety of different circumstances. My ideas about constraints you could use experimental bond angle ranges predictively how much synthesis/prediction can really be done how often do symmetric molecules 'flip flop' or are they really static? what effect from/on brownian motion?

Places to get help there are a number of places you can get help. The easiest is the #rust IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org, which you can access through Mibbit. At that address you can chat with other Rustaceans (a silly nickname we call ourselves) who can help you out. Other great resources include the Users forum and Stack Overflow. Local Documentation try: rustup doc rustup Switch between stable and nightly you will need some or all of these: rustup update rustup install nightly switch with: rustup default nightly or rustup default stable rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated . It makes cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms. And it runs on all platforms Rust supports, including Windows. (emphasis mine) rustup is a toolchain multiplexer. It installs and manages many Rust toolchains and presents them all through a single set of tools installed to ~/.cargo/bin. The rustc and cargo installed to ~/.cargo/bin are proxies that delegate to the real toolchain. rustup then provides mechanisms to easily change the active toolchain by reconfiguring the behavior of the proxies. Clippy Linter - nightly only. Use it! Playpen You can put your rust in a gist and put it in Playpen and then share it with others who can see it run. Good tool for collaboration. Crater I don't think this is useful until I'm trying to switch between stable and nightly with tons of dependencies. detect regressions in rust compiler against a bunch of crates github project Check the differences between stable and target only for sandboxed environments, it's very destructive... so I guess only on vms. Cargo howto: specify cargo dependencies This is manual... but I prefer cargo-edit so far for add/rm/upgrade Make sure to cargo install cargo-edit This gives you the ability to use cargo add/rm/upgrade <crate> for example cargo add num_bigint Rust cargo guide Cargo is a tool that allows Rust projects to declare their various dependencies and ensure that you\u2019ll always get a repeatable build. To accomplish this goal, Cargo does four things: Introduces two metadata files with various bits of project information. Fetches and builds your project\u2019s dependencies. Invokes rustc or another build tool with the correct parameters to build your project. Introduces conventions to make working with Rust projects easier. GDB GDB supports Rust Lizzie says no one uses it \"The Book 2nd Ed.\" aka \"The Rust Programming Language\" When you finish this you will be an intermediate rust programmer. In general, this book assumes that you\u2019re reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the topic in a later chapter. You\u2019ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project chapters. In concept chapters, you\u2019ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project chapters, we\u2019ll build small programs together, applying what you\u2019ve learned so far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters. Rust 101 Youtube (20 Jan 2017) Speaker: E. Dunham; @qedunham (Mozilla) source slides Exercises Rustlings repo Rust By Example book Macros Macros are syntactic sugar for functions that take a variable number of arguments... Need more content, see rust book v2. Inclusive and Exclusive Ranges .. is an exclusive range, ..= is an inclusive range This is true for both matches and expressions The old match-only inclusive range syntax ... is still acceptable in match-only but not recommended and does not work in expressions See rust book v2 appendix 6 Notes Rust is an expression based language Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. let y = 6; is a statement, it does not return a value Expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Expressions can be parts of statements: in let y = 6 , the 6 is an expression that evaluates to 6 . calling a function or calling a macro is an expression calling the block to create new scopes, {} , is an expression a function can have an expression and it will be returned by the function other languages don't have the same distinctions blocks of code inside if expressions or match expressions are sometimes called arms Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them Chapter 2 Switching from an expect call to a match expression is how you generally move from crashing on an error to handling the error. Remember that parse returns a Result type and Result is an enum that has the variants Ok or Err . We\u2019re using a match expression here, as we did with the Ordering result of the cmp method. --- snip --- If parse is not able to turn the string into a number, it will return an Err value that contains more information about the error. The Err value does not match the Ok(num) pattern in the first match arm, but it does match the Err(_) pattern in the second arm. The underscore, _ , is a catchall value; in this example, we\u2019re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm\u2019s code, continue , which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the loop and ask for another guess. So effectively, the program ignores all errors that parse might encounter! Chapter 3 Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, we\u2019ve only covered functions without an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don\u2019t have the same distinctions, so let\u2019s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions. We\u2019ve actually already used statements and expressions. Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Let\u2019s look at some examples. So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you\u2019re unsure, Rust\u2019s defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to i32: this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which you\u2019d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection. Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision. Rust\u2019s char type represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. However, a \u201ccharacter\u201d isn\u2019t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a \u201ccharacter\u201d is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. We\u2019ll discuss this topic in detail in \u201cStrings\u201d in Chapter 8. Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership (ownership, references, borrowing, slices) Lifetimes are not covered in this chapter, see chapter 10. I think this most related to borrowing with async, which sounds like a hairball. Chapter 5: Using Structs to Structure Related Data Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program\u2019s domain to take full advantage of Rust\u2019s compile time type checking. Use let to instantiate struct with kv pairs (not ordered). Use dot notation to get a value back from a struct. Entire struct instance must be mutable, not certain fields of struct instance. Mutability is on the instance not the struct definition Struct Instantiaton Example This valid expression is returned from the function and expressed in the function signature: fn build_user ( email : String , username : String ) -> User { User { email : email , username : username , active : true , sign_in_count : 1 , } } Resources Resources from main rust site. \"Are we _ yet?\" web app stuff game stuff also check out \"things that are not awesome yet in rust \" Articles Summaries go below. A list of 'fearless rust bloggers' Tutorials & Workshop Materials hackr.io tutorials \"Rust for Python Developers\" by Armin Ronacher Mutability, Borrows, and Owners Functions that operate on immutable borrows are marked as &self and functions that need a mutable borrow are marked as &mut self. You can only loan out references if you are the owner. If you want to move the value out of the function (for instance by returning it) you cannot have any outstanding loans and you cannot loan out values after having moved ownership away from yourself. This is a big change in how you think about programs but you will get used to it.

Remember that parse returns a Result type and Result is an enum that has the variants Ok or Err . We\u2019re using a match expression here, as we did with the Ordering result of the cmp method. --- snip --- If parse is not able to turn the string into a number, it will return an Err value that contains more information about the error. The Err value does not match the Ok(num) pattern in the first match arm, but it does match the Err(_) pattern in the second arm. The underscore, _ , is a catchall value; in this example, we\u2019re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm\u2019s code, continue , which tells the program to go to the next iteration of the loop and ask for another guess. So effectively, the program ignores all errors that parse might encounter!","title":"Chapter 2"},{"location":"docs/references/rust_plan/#chapter-3","text":"Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, we\u2019ve only covered functions without an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don\u2019t have the same distinctions, so let\u2019s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions. We\u2019ve actually already used statements and expressions. Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Let\u2019s look at some examples. So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you\u2019re unsure, Rust\u2019s defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to i32: this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which you\u2019d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection. Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision. Rust\u2019s char type represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. However, a \u201ccharacter\u201d isn\u2019t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a \u201ccharacter\u201d is may not match up with what a char is in Rust.

Space Domination: A modern release of stardart: http://www.spacedomination.org/index.php/play/ Build Ticks Build ticks are 10 seconds, measured with a stopwatch. Races It depends on if you need to maximize your acceleration into the game, your fleet power, your total build capacity, or your fleet retention. Raw score bonuses are the best long term, but fleet combat can make or break the game, heavily favoring Avarians. Human gets a bonus stardart, can help you win Master24: They can double score darts if it lands on their phenomenon or stellurae Bonus, 1/3 chance of scoring extra dart on owned phenomenon and stellurae. Avarian get to bring station in fleet, very OP for combat and max fleet size Zorestians get -20% decay, I think it means they start at world decay? Solid but can be supplemented by worlds instead. Makluvians - best merchant world build, best build speed, if you need to max that, probably best acceleration in the game. Quick Facts From manual: https://www.spacedomination.org/index.php/the-galaxy/ World Population The population regulates what and how many global facilities you can build as well as how fast building goes. Industry used to be 4x population. Is it still true? Home Worlds According to player \"sunny\" humans are sector 0, i think every game. North Northeast of OE. I am in sector 5, west of OE. Clockwise from OE increases sector Home World \u2013 Rich Planets supporting high industry Technical: 150 population (2250 industry max) Starting with Refinery, 3 of all minerals. If the home world is from your own race you will get a declaration of planets/phenomenon from the owner. This declaration can be seen on the Settings page of the Login Screen, as it can change depending on galaxy size. World Moods Worlds can revolt if happiness goes below some threshold, destroying industry. I assume this reduces pollution increasing happiness, so it will equilibrate naturally. Angry: None Annoyed: Merchant Content: Merchant and Beacon Happy: Merchant, Beacon, and Blaster Ecstatic: No limitations (Stardock) World Colors Blue with Orange Border - Old Earth Old Earth Technical: 200 population (3000 industry max) Starting with refinery, 3 of all minerals. Old Earth will start with Star Darts based on the number of worlds in the game. If taken you will get a percentage of planets/phenomenon from the owner of the planet. You can see the current set ratio on the Settings page of the login screen. BrightOrange - Core, rich worlds around Old Earth Core Worlds Technical: 100 population (1500 industry max) Starting with Refinery, 3 of all minerals. Purple - Merchant - population/30 + 1 merchants Maroon - Beacon - population/8 + 1 beacons Orange - Stardock - population/40 + 1 stardocks Red - Blaster - population/50 + 1 blasters Orange-red - Rich, 50% more build points Magenta - Poor, 50% less build points White - Normal, standard Orange Textured - Large - +20% Population, +1 all minerals Blue-Purple - Small - -20% Population Grey Smooth - Toxic - -60% Population, low industry Grey Textured - 2x faster industry build Blue - Sloops - 3 Pladesium Khaki - Frigates - 3 Frelenium Aqua - Corsairs - 3 Calastium Green - Stations - 3 Stenterium Red with Orange Stripe - Ranger - 3 S World Minerals Generation seems random with bonuses or guarantees for special worlds. 1 == 0.5x 2 == 1.0x 3 == 1.5x chiisana (player) says: 1 = 1/2 speed; 2 = full speed; 3 = twice(?) as fast Master24: 1.5x The world minerals start with the same letter as their ship except slooP and Pladesium. If you have none of a given mineral, you cannot build the corresponding ship, and if you have 3 of it you can build that ship at a quicker rate. Do the high mineral worlds correspond to the colored worlds above? What is a normal world's minerals? Rich world? Large world? Notes: - this Large world has 2 of all minerals and 3 of 2 minerals... which? - this merchant world has 3 revidium/ranger and holds 4 merchants max - merchant world with 1 revidium, 2 pladesium, 3 merchant max Pladesium: Sloops Calastium: Corsairs Frelenium: Frigates Stenterium: Stations Revidium: Rangers World Industry * Happiness ] Mightymo: Happiness will increase over time, And it works by percent Industry influences pollution as a % of total industry. Happiness increases over time Planets in home sector will be happier, home sector is the same sector as your race's homeworld. Anomalies Blue = slower Green = faster Early Strategy Fleet Fleet ECM is an important factor, so emphasize rangers. Fleets have a max size, but you won't hit it until you are harvesting worlds for fleets. Worlds Cannot afford much early on, so really need to pump fleet build up! Stardock is a goal. So is stellurae, but not yet attainable. Rangers are highly preferred thanks to their attack speed and ECM. To build stations? It is relevant once you hit max world fleet. You need the ecm for defense against other players as well. I think it's definitely worth it. Modern Strategy Blaster worlds seem very highly powered, assuming they are a fleet multiplier. If the fleet limit is normal, then blaster is the endgame. Blaster is also useful at all stages since it augments fleet power at peak non/attrition, increasing conquest speed. However, every non-merchant world will increase fleet harvesting times. Riffing on the classic strategy, we want to avoid pollution, so avoid building industry. It won't matter compared to merchants and stardocks. I think early stardocks are very useful to half the fleet attrition with a cost of only 10 global facilities. I also think that a template build based on fleet composition is the best option, stick to the long game. Questions Can I have 1 of each facility available on each planet? That is fantastic. What is sector? Can I use it to get to richer worlds? How is it better than distance from Old Earth? The population regulates what and how many global facilities you can build as well as how fast building goes. How much industry per pollution, how does pollution impact happiness? Is the max fleet size still present? Is industry with refinery worth it? It is a local facility. Note the tradeoff is that stellurae is now a local facility. Since Stellurae doesn't interfere with Merchant/Stardock strategy it may actually be worth it instead of industry+refinery. Classic Strategy focus on building tons of merchants so you can harvest your worlds. Ignore everything else. Fleet build balance is based exclusively on max fleet size. Eventually your fleet attrition will be high, then start balancing in Stardocks. Build some beacons early as you want to reap the benefits of fast travel early. Sometimes you need to remove beacons to avoid navigation problems. Avoid stardarts. Global Facilities Classic: focus on building tons of merchants so you can harvest your worlds. Ignore everything else. Merchants thedudeabides: Currently getting 7.77/37 increase - Master24: Yup, some races have added / decreased per merchant `(7.98*.95)/38 == 0.2% world build increase per Merchant, that's subtracting the human bonus and allowing for floating points...

I think so! Will have to manage it when it revolts. It is +50% industry, so move in a bit before investing. Strafing worlds What's the easiest way to get 10k guns? Probably 10 worlds with 50% industry. Note that with 500 industry or 500 build, the worlds can easily finish merchant in about 2 minutes, so I think it is more efficient to set industry, then set merchant and leave. Industry takes 100 industry, so it might be good to kick start. Does population count towards build points? With 100 population, 1 industry per tick, so 500/6== 83 minutes to 500 industry. Target 90+ population worlds with a fleet about 8k-15k. The cutoff is to get 4 merchants. 50 industry all merchants up to 50% industry - dont wait on it to complete... build ships for 3 resource, then 2 build if no 3, 1 build if no 2 or 3... repeat, prioritize rangers solo early NO beacons early, 10 gave me like 1% increase in speed. Can get them once a few hundred merchants make building them 1-2 ticks. Note: 74 pop blaster world gave 12 blasters...absolutely huge. chiisana says try to get over 25 blasters at the beginning with 1-2 blaster worlds and some normal worlds. Notes & Anecdata chiisana: I personally like to do 30% industry, amenity, fly away and come back to it much later Storage attrition rollover tells you your build poins basically. Once you get to the storage of required - build points, you will complete the build next pulse with 0 attrition. Not fully validated. Sunny or someone says: 80k guns for a core world to be safe, 20k guns for a dart, you can roll over homeworlds with 120k guns Had a beacon world at 6000w-OE with 2 merchant, 4 beacon 34 pop Industry seems to be 10x population. Not sure how pollution is calculated from industry... A merchant world with 20 popl, 200 industry, severe pollution, ecstatic population, 3 revidium, no local facility, and 4 merchant facilities just gave me 800 guns of rangers 6180 seems to be the limit around my local... the old game used to increase the universe size if there were more players in the previous game. I found a beacon world around 5000 out from Old Earth and it had only 1 beacon. I guess it is +1 to +3 or something and this one natively had 0? I just found a normal planet with 2 merchants allowed. I don't know why. It also has 30 pop, 300 industry An early large world that I added full industry+factory to is Happy and producing several hundred guns after a wait. Even though pollution is severe, happiness is only very slowly going down, making it worth it for early harvest. TAKEAWAY: focus on large worlds early Worlds used to become more populated as approaching Old Earth, still true? If so focus on going that direction, as population affects global facilities on special worlds. Large world with max industry and a factory is losing happiness to pollution, but at the beginning I can't build enough \"storage\" build for a refinery to reduce pollution so I will try an amenity facility to keep them happy... but I can't seem to get to 8000 either, I may abandon the world and try some without industry to get fleet build up. Looks like merchants increase world build by a percentage, is it flat per merchant? That makes it kind of interesting rather than a flat value, since world build can be quite low without industry or factories. So this incentivizes me to build industry and factories. Scores \"cap\" - my cap - when your score accumulates to its full potential. The required score to win goes down 1% every 4 hours. Homeworlds are a good way to boost scores. Getting a homeworld is about 2.95% of total points when capped. Strategies Attacking Others You can reduce their global garrison power by ganking mech and stardock worlds where industry == 10x population . Spiral out from OE and follow a route that is working. It's easy to gank someone's merch if they are all in a row, but hard to collect guns if they are not. I think it might be better to have a guns place near OE then merch hunting via gates. Player Strategies & Alliances chiisani and waffle are brothers and ganged up on Sunny. Gawdawful seems to target merchants very heavily if people keep grudges, change names Misc Strategy Notes What about scumming/traveling for good worlds? Then the enemies cant follow your line and you have a facilities multiplier. Especially effective if you have a low attrition fleet... like stardarts, but then combat is slow... This 80 pop merch world has 16 merchant capacity. Wild. I can build merchants without command at 500 build. Base build is pop+ind. What is the minimum threshold build to build a merchant? 830/2+83 aka 83 pop planet is 498 build which is fine... how about 60 pop? 60+600/2 == 360 is that enough for merchant? A 90 population stardock world yields 15 stardocks. But have to get happiness up... I will try amenity on Icelu at 1859 north of OE Move into the 90 pop worlds early and build 4 merchants per world and optimize the queue, build 50% industry. Once you can build refinery, about 1500 gross build (incl factories), do 100% industry. Basically the tradeoff is pop vs command build if you build full industry. You could build factory to build refinery with only 66% otherwise required population.... but it's too slow Somehow Sunny has 147 merch with 48 worlds... must be cherry picking in the inner system. Chiisana says worlds x 4 == merch worlds early on is reasonable. The gates are a single large circuit predetermined. The size scales with galaxy size. The loop is apparently often about 30 gates. Gates can be used to get to a home sector, get closer to OE for better worlds, or scum a certain kind of world, but those worlds are also more discoverable by playeers.","title":"Stardart Spacedomination"},{"location":"docs/references/stardart_spacedomination/#space-domination-aka-stardart","text":"One of my favorite games from the 90s.

Apache Airflow A batch workflow orchestrator. Especially for large data pipelines . The tasks really accumulate and orchestrating really become a challenge... denormalize, something, something else.... What is Airflow - 5 min An open source platform to author, schedule, and monitor batch processes. It's the glue that binds your data ecosystem together. It orchestrates tasks in a complex network of job dependencies. It's Python all the way down. It's popular and has a thriving open source community. It's expressive and dynamic, workflows are defined in code. Airflow is configuration as code and pipelines as code . We are going to get into why configuration as code is such a powerful concept. DAG is a fancy acronym that also just means workflow in this context (and Directed Acyclic Graph). Hive and Spark operators with a DAG to define topology of workflow . Data Engineering Patterns - Foundational Pattern for all examples Concept: building data pipelines dynamically A classic data warehouse is pretty static. Dimension tables, fact tables. Processes roughly for every table. Airflow is dynamic, breaks out of this pattern. Pipelines dynamically built that read configuration. Configuration as code Why use code instead of drag-and-drop data pipelines? Because it naturally gets source control and design patterns are easier to pull and collaborate on. Configuration as code is more powerful than good ole configuration files . Code is more expressive, powerful, and compact Resuable components (functions, classes, object factories) come naturally in code. An API has a clear specification with defaults, input validation, and useful methods. Allow users to hook logic to configuration as callbacks. SEE IMAGE IN PHONE FOR REST. Conceptual Model SEE PHOTO Example 1: AB Testing Example Lets change a Lyft button to be a brighter shade of pink. Airflow script to read configuration of all these experiments and metrics and weave a workflow of dependency based on the input of the user. As the workflow executes, it waits on source data, processes metrics and experiments. Comes out with P-value, confidence interval, other computations. These become exposed in the UI. Computation Frameworks AutoDAG at AirBnB - lots of people run sql and they just want to schedule it to run every day. Might not want to set up a pipeline. Built a simple UI as an airflow plugin, AutoDAG , they paste what they run and give it a target table, finds dependencies, creates waitfor operator, hivepartitionsensors, lints code and gives advice, and schedules the workflow and alerts on failure. Simplest implementation of this pattern Source code for autodag is extremely simple, couple dozen lines of code. Example 2: Engagement & Growth Metrics - web companies and most industries, aka \"Growth Accounting Metrics\" DAU, WAU, MAU / new, churn, resurrected, stale and active users Wrote this for all of facebook then replicated for different verticals: photos, messaging, photo uploads - anything you can think of we wanted a flavor of this pipeline. Count distinct metrics are ... slide is gone... (try to get the slides) Framework reads the config file and builds a very complex framework on your behalf. Behind the scene / at Facebook There's a photo that has a bunch of bullets for how this configuration works (he said 'behind the Python') Runs optimized logic If building the same pipeline over and over, some older ones won't be optimized. Why not improve the old whenever you improve the new?

How to make a Stats Daemon Model metastore, ask metastore for schema of table, ask rule engine to build sql automatically. Use presto and pivot the result, attach to partition in a skinny table. He verbally said the following: A stats daemon is the idea of computing database stats on top of your data warehouse. People who know about classic RDBMS, mysql, oracle, postgres, etc. These stats are stored in the schema for the query optimizer to plan.- Hive etc. do not compute these stats but people can leverage these stats too, beyond the query optimizer.- Every time we see something changes in hive or hive metadata we compute a bunch more metadata.- (See photo for this slide and copy the text below... ) - - More!

You can let the code generator build it then modify it yourself... how? what? I think it's written in python so you need to paste it in or something... no idea Data Classes - PEP 557 has landed Validates that NamedTuple was doing the right thing but we need mutable. And a cool name. Immutable if you want (possible to freeze the data) PEP says - mutable namedtuples with defaults main design goal is to support static type checkers highly opinionated about typing, no way to use it without typing static typing was optional, not here... you can put a type of None or any and it will be ignored. have to explicitly opt out of typing with None or any raymond is working on a workaround boilerplate for class, attribute based dataholder is it a code generator? is it a data holder? two different ways of looking at it generates code for you, generates class docstring, init , repr , eq with strong typechecking, rich comparisons, hashing, read-only enforced by setattr , delattr from dataclasses import make_dataclass - this thing is huge unless there are slots... but with slots you lose defaults - the language has a built in constraint against slots and defaults at the same time Do you always know if something is going to be integer float? No. 12.5 timezones off in india! When you import types it actually executes code... so there is debate about whether they will stringify types in make_dataclass if you read python-dev you will get all of the drama emulate a namedtuple (see slides) with from operator import itemgetter and dataclasses Summary I have been studying dataclasses since the first draft of PEP 557. I really like the new dataclasses! If you need mutable named tuples today, try George Sakkis's Record class or use the attached dataclass code that runs fine on Python3.6 but not prior. (code in raymond's slides) See the 4 tuple code generator table: Namedtuple, Record, Dataclasses, Dataclasses w/ slots Gains and losses (see the slides) Some Nice Improvements (see the slides) Some things that aren't as nice higher complexity and learning curve, 700 ish lines of code, couple hundred lines of tests, lots of specs. dataclasses is its own miniature ORM for python stuff, declare, fields() function, hashable, etc. (see the slides) Inside the sphinx slides this talk is from, you can cut and paste raymond's code and use it now.","title":"Sfpython Holidayparty Raymondhettinger 20171207"},{"location":"docs/talks/SFPython_HolidayParty_RaymondHettinger_20171207/#raymond-hettinger-holiday-party-talk-2017","text":"Raymond says: I will tweet out a link to this presentation later.

ALWAYS START WITH estimator AND experiment APIs These come from Google trying to productionize tensorflow, probably successfully. See the slide, has the above title!!!!!!!! Skip all the early demos you see, they are old and crusty. These simplify model building. flexible parameter tuning enable rapid model experiments Estimator API See the slides. Train-to-Serve Design Create custom or use a canned Estimator Hides session, graph layers, Chief:Worker Supervisor:Worker getting away from master but not improving their language... just changing it... Canned Estimators See the slides, 60% use prebuilt, 40% roll their own estimator Commonly used estimators Pre tested and pre tuned Multi-headed inference: Single-Objective Estimator vs Multi-Objective Estimator Get two answers (objectives out of one estimator or something). Hparams - Hyper parameter tuning Do a big grid search, a parameter as a range. Layers API exists Use kubernetes or mesos Good cluster organizer for working on this stuff... JIT Compiler - and visualizing Need to do a Python Context Manager with device as... whatever to use JIT. Historically: Spark & Project Tungsten would take your code and create your plan into an optimized one and then to a physical plan. Built on XLA - accelerated linear algebra framework. Goals reduce memory Movement reduce overhead of multiple function calls AOT Compiler - Standalone, Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compiler For super tiny devices... pass in your graph. Build up DAGs of operations in spark and tensorflow. tfcompile - point to input for graph and output for graph built on XLA framework creates functions with feeds (inputs) and fetches (outputs) figures out what everything... .so files, what bare minimum is necessary creates binary down to 600k - this is how we fit in the apple app store or not. shrink, shrink, tons of slides, freeze for production request batch tuning At the end of the day the forward prop. is just matrix multiplies.

Three R's of Ian's talk: R Remember Reveal Winning Work As a consultant you are winning work or performing work and it's hard to balance. Winning Rewarding, Profitable Work Rewarding - The work takes you where you want to go Profitable - You can do it Credibility Starts with not having a gmail account Starts with a real business card Starts with a decent name Example: xenogonyx Most of your work comes from word of mouth If your client's can't remember, they can't tell anyone about you Example: IG Partners Says you are consulting and your clients can remember it Ian's first impression is: Linkedin 3-5 page website home, services, about, contact us, resources Some orgs put aol.com, hotmail.com, yahoo.com accounts right in the bin People that have no technical competency? AOL still makes 917 million a year on dialup accounts, residual income Build a brand Acronym: \"Every Consultant Is Awesome\" These are in order. 1, most important.... 4. least important Expectation Commonality Intent Ability Expectation - Most important. Are you the consultant they expected? Are you wearing a suit if that is expected Dress and behave for your audience Business card like they would expect \"It's about Clues, not Views\" You are 'disappointed about the superbowl' but they won... oops Political views, technology views let them explain how it all works Commonality - Do you have anything in common with them? Kids the same age, musical instrument interest, anything Intent - Are you there to help them get it done? Are you just there for the day rate Are you there to make it work If you can't help them, don't go!! Ability - Can you do the job? Clearly it's important, but it's below the other three Differentiation Price is the main difference between two consultants that can do the work. How do you differentiate your work? Why is one person worth $1000 a day and another $1200 a day. Anecdote, he worked with a client and they did a perfect job on a $150MM job and all the client could remember a year later was day rate. Intent: What are you passionate about? What are you good at? Skills? Web Designer: There are so many of those. Align yourself with a product. Example: Be a salesforce consultant, or something. You don't know when a client wants to start You don't know when they want to make a business change Need to spend time getting up to speed on a product It's like the trains are going by and you gotta jump on the one It's great to do something you love, but is it profitable? Is money your primary measure? If so, you have to adapt. Are you going to build a 40-person business marketing to startups? Salesforce's limiting factor for growth is business consultants Probably true for microsoft azure, google cloud, aws, rackspace How do you make your project URGENT? \"You cannot make a consulting project start by sheer will\" Tying yourself to a product coaching based on their business pipeline Compliance is another fantastic URGENT incentive. \"If we don't do this by december, the FDA fines us 100MM dollars\" We have to start now, just write the check. What about IP to differentiate yourself? A business methodology - for example Accenture's 'Lightning' Method I have methodologies out there right now Methodology used in your \"sales cycle\" Way you perform the business cycle with your client Example: lawyer - Methodology can be used to convince a client \"Trust me we have the metrics and here are our standard templates\" How much does your methodology increase your day rate and win rate? Profitability Make enough to spend your life the way you want to spend it A sold consulting firm in silicon valley makes 1 to 1.5 times revenue An investor wants to make 5x revenue on that form The three things discussed below: Fix bigger problems Project Management Minimize Bench Time Annuity Revenue Streams Sorry, but it's REALLY HARD to build a consultancy to the second stage. Up to 5 is pretty good. The next stopping point after 3-4 people is twenty. The bit between 5-20 is REALLY HARD. Consulting business with 30+ starts to get momentum: marketing, salespeople Your consultants need something to do between assignments, they aren't just going to develop the business, it isn't what they do. First way is to charge more. How? FIRST THING: Fix bigger problems Application developers - awesome - ukraine Configure systems - above applications Management consultants - above configure (doing business and development) Run big projects - above management (12 weeks, name the day rate) 3500 a day, 12 weeks, bring in the team, i pay you on top of the team Ian: i ROI for that client was 95,000 a day Ian's biggest project, never got that again Running workshops, business consulting Run big programs - above projects Writing books - MARKETING GOLD DUST \"Common Approach, Common Results\" - gets them business today, it was his first one You can't throw a book away, you can give it away but never get rid of it Way better than white papers, they've got a spine! jogging vs marathon Secret is 80 pages - then you have a spine, and it's a book. people love books How do you turn those blogs into something? Project Management - best way to increase your day rate Scope is the intersection of: time, cost, quality If you don't have it down at the beginning you've lost the project If you can't get the scope agreed, leave the project!! This is a real lesson he learned in accenture. Scope, timeframe, skillset => all comes back to scope \"What's the case study going to be like when we get you up on stage?\" Get them focused on how they deliver the project, so you can focus on how they deliver the project Minimize Bench Time Get people around you so you can work together and rely on each other and make sure no one has any bench time Work for clients who don't screw you over all the time ShipClients - glassdoor for clients, was renamed to \"RateClient\" For independent consultants to rate clients on 3 things Too long to get project started Scope creep Pay you correctly and on time http://clientsfromhell.net Annuity Revenue Streams Writing books isn't it! You don't make any money out of books, they up your day rate. Books also cost very little. Silicon Valley is all aboute Annuity Revenue Stream. Could you license some IP? Could other consultants use your metholodogy? Can you get 20% of a revenue stream? Could you build a support service? Be the best you can be Always be yourself, unless you can be Batman. Then always be batman. Always test the boundary of how much you can charge. Day rate: $500, $800, $1000, $2000 - always move it up!! Notes He says technical skills are worthless, amazing eastern european developers cost $20 an hour, so it's all about access to technical skills. Innovative websites don't work. It's why all product websites and carts are the same. Questions How do you be awesome if you don't have a resume that says you worked for the big 5? Ian: It may not be who you worked for but who your clients have been in the past. Example: The best part of the book is the back cover with quotes by people that love them. Everyone reads the back -- this book must be incredible. How do you get a client to use your name? A bunch of clients will, some people won't put it through their legal people. Find people who will bat for you. If it's a book, it can further their career. Find win-wins. What about partnerships? Equity partnerships - you need to be super careful. Getting a divorce is hard. Are you both aligned? Are you both putting the same amount of time on it? \"We'll work it out in the end?\" Very difficult to unwind if it goes wrong. How much do you spend on marketing when do you stop? As a small business, SEO, facebook marketing, etc. are a huge waste. BEST: Networking events where you can work together to figure out how to get clients. BEST: Write a book or a paper, they hang around forever! BEST: Linkedin relationships, article worth reading on linkedin Make sure to get writing out there. What are you really good at? Where are they? Salesforce: all on twitter. Why? No one knows!! 430 salesforce user groups - marin, sf, etc. Every other week. half consultants and half clients!! there's an ecosystem remember: salesforce growth blocker is consultants. How do I move up a tier on project size? Confidence to bid for bigger projects Being there already - take a bigger project with a current client. Who else do you need around?

Move utility functions to utils.py (tag: v0.2) url_for, timestamp functions. 2. Refactor database models. (tag: v0.3) Avoid cyclic dependency of importing db from controller then importing model from models.py Add a check for main in models.py, if there isn't a main then fallback to ugly hardcoded \"from flack import db\". 3. Create an Application Package (tag: v0.4) - Use Flask-Script A newer option exists over Flask-Script but is not yet production ready. Flask-Script is available now: https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ See git diff v0.3 v0.4 between these two tags to understand necessary changes. 4. Refactoring API Authentication (tag: v0.5) - Moved auth stuff to auth.py. There were three auth functions finally imported. Again see git diff v0.4 v0.5 for details. 5. Refactoring Tests (tag: v0.6) - Change to a package style folder structure. To get the overview, checkout this tag and manage.py. Look at file structure. Now we are in a django style construction. tests folder exists alongside flack folder. 6. Refactoring Configuration (tag: v0.7) - Add a config.py next to manage.py. Add a config.py. This is pretty hairy even in django. People solve configuration in different ways. I have a pretty good django dev.cfg/prod.cfg pattern that I would use here. 7. Create an API Blueprint - separate the api. Create: flack/api.py . Use a Blueprint. Blueprint is initialized where app creation is done, currently flack.py. 8. Create Stats package. See git diff v0.8 v0.9 9. Using an application Factory Function (tag: v0.10) - use a Blueprint for app. Sometimes it is desirable to work with more than one application Best Example: Unit tests that need applications with different configurations. SPECIAL NOTE: Having app blueprints allows you to have a really elegant test setup and teardown. Howto get the Blueprint working (see git diff v0.9 v.10 for exact code) We need to get rid of app because it will exist outside the context of the controller. Now we can no longer reference app. We must refactor app.config and other references to app. That means no app.debug. To achieve this we can use a Blueprint. Use the current_app context variable to access application. Put application factory function in init .py, see create_app function here. To create an app you now call create_app, pass an application name, and get the app. SQLAlchemy needs the models in init .py because it introspects on the app. You can miss this and maybe the models get imported elsewhere but that is sloppy. 10. Creating an API Package (tag: v0.11) - Turn api.py into a package. This is a simple step, make an api folder and break the components of api.py down into the 3 files/modules: tokens, messages, users. tokens, messages, users become modules inside of the api package. Part II - Scaling Flask for Production. Notes from Miguel Grinberg's talk on making a production flask app. PyCon 2016 - 20160528 0900 PST Presentation URL: Miguel will put a URL in the github readme and tweet the link. Scaling Web Servers Problem - one request at a time. Not great. Multiple Threads Limited use of multiple threads because of GIL. Not really great. Multiple processes Obviously multiple apps sounds nice. Each process has its own set of things. What about SQLAlchemy? Green threads / coroutines - asyncio, gevent, eventlet. Flask doesn't support asyncio. Flask does support gevent, eventlet. IO and standard library threading functions are incompatible. How about manually triggering a switch? - sleep function to take a break and let other threads have a turn. Note on gevent and eventlet -- A lot of people get this wrong on stack overflow. This stuff isn't for cpu intensive work. All green threads need a chance to run and CPU must be available or sleeps must run very often to let the scheduler switch. Miguel's IO library is for this. Read more about this. I have it in other notes but a google search will suffice. Both eventlet and gevent allow monkeypatching to coroutine friendly functions (overwrite standard library function with the coroutine friendly function). Using Production Web Servers (tag: v0.12) gunicorn Limited load balancing - Why limited? I will have to look this up. Written in Python - robust but not lightning fast Supports multiple processes, and eventlet or gevent green threads. uwsgi nginx Written in C. Ideal for serving static files in production. You expose the static file in the nginx config. Bottlenecks: I/O Bound and CPU Bound I/O Bottlenecks Flack example: scraping links included in posts Solution: concurrent request handlers through multiple threads, processes, or green threads. Make I/O heavy requests asynchronous. CPU Bottlenecks Flack example: rendering posts from markdown to HTML Solution: Offload CPU intensive requests to auxiliary threads or processes to keep the server unblocked. Rephrased: make CPU intensive requests asynchronous. Asynchronous HTTP Requests (tag: v0.13) Request starts background work, gives a status 202. Goes back to listening requests. Location header has a status URL where the client can ask for status for the asynchronous task. Request to status URL returns 202 while the request is still in progress. When complete, (see presentation for details) There is a decorator for this in flack , migue's app.... @async decorator. That's all that is necessary!!! This is almost too easy. If you git diff v0.12 v0.13 and view the tasks module, you can see async implemenation. note that request.environ has environmental information to build a request object. This way miguel can build his own request object. Miguel uses threading here, I think this won't matter because the threads are being used inside of a single request. We went into great detail about the @async decorator code. Miguel mentioned maybe he should test it more and build a flask extension out of it. Probably production ready but definitely not widely tested. Async really gets into the guts of flask and does a lot of stuff flask does manually building the response etc. it looks good but it just isn't vetted and I don't know enough flask futs to vet it. Celery Workers (tag: v0.14) There's a wrapper in manage.py . Celery is integrated into the previous async section. For quick setup redis works with Celery. Celery needs to be available in init .py for the same reason as the model. Flask uses the context apparently. There must be something else since flask doesn't really 'expect' celery. Maybe celery is loaded up in the app then refers to stuff.. Still seems a little circular. Websocket (tag: v0.15) - clients must 'poll' to stay up to date... we need to use 'server-push' to reduce load when new stuff happens. This \"server-push\" websocket model will reduce load, removing all redundant quests. The previous version used 2 requests per second per client just to stay up to date. Options: 1. Streaming 2. Long-polling 3. WebSocket 4. Socket.IO (long-polling + WebSocket) Streaming One of Miguel Grinberg's Posts using Streaming (1): http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask Long polling client asks 'is there anything new?' but the server doesn't respond right away. it waits maybe 10 seconds because nothing happened. it does block the thread but it doesn't respond until something changes or until the long poll times out. A new one can then be generated. WebSocket HTML5 Standard. Not HTTP anymore. Both connections can write to the other side at any time. Any side can write/read at any time. SocketIO written in JS. Node.js service. SocketIO Protocol supports WebSocket and falls aback to long-polling if WebSocket isn't supported by the client. Type 1: Python client: use socketio.emit class in a push_model method. See slides. Javascript server: socketio node.js service Type 2: Python Server: @socketio.on() decorator Javascript client: socket.emit(). See slides. Even more Socket.IO. We can now only use gevent or eventlet. See the events.py module git diff v0.14 v0.15 , added to manage events. I'm pretty far afield of things I have actually done at this point so my thoughts aren't very helpful. This code is starting to look a ton like django. However, I don't think Django has async built in either, so maybe this is a limit for out-of-the-box django as well. More research needed. Need an auxiliary wsgi process for socketio. There is a second wsgi_aux.py or something in the source. Miguel used eventlet.monkey_patch() to replace a bunch of stuff with eventlet counterparts. This seems pretty specific, better know what you are doing and read the monkey patch code. manage.py runserver needs socketio stuff. Socketio needs socketio.run, rather than app.run, so this gets added in. Also see tests. socketio has its own test client. Finally nginx has requirements for load balancing. Nginx option \"sticky sessions\" Grep the flack.conf in the nginx folder for ip_hash and read about this nginx option. Socketio is stateful and rest APIs are stateless so this option is necessary.

To create an app you now call create_app, pass an application name, and get the app. SQLAlchemy needs the models in init .py because it introspects on the app. You can miss this and maybe the models get imported elsewhere but that is sloppy.","title":"Howto get the Blueprint working (see git diff v0.9 v.10 for exact code)"},{"location":"docs/talks/pycon2016_grinberg_flaskprod/#10-creating-an-api-package-tag-v011-turn-apipy-into-a-package","text":"This is a simple step, make an api folder and break the components of api.py down into the 3 files/modules: tokens, messages, users. tokens, messages, users become modules inside of the api package.","title":"10.

Notes from Miguel Grinberg's talk on making a production flask app. PyCon 2016 - 20160528 0900 PST Presentation URL: Miguel will put a URL in the github readme and tweet the link. Scaling Web Servers Problem - one request at a time. Not great. Multiple Threads Limited use of multiple threads because of GIL. Not really great. Multiple processes Obviously multiple apps sounds nice. Each process has its own set of things. What about SQLAlchemy? Green threads / coroutines - asyncio, gevent, eventlet. Flask doesn't support asyncio. Flask does support gevent, eventlet. IO and standard library threading functions are incompatible. How about manually triggering a switch? - sleep function to take a break and let other threads have a turn. Note on gevent and eventlet -- A lot of people get this wrong on stack overflow. This stuff isn't for cpu intensive work. All green threads need a chance to run and CPU must be available or sleeps must run very often to let the scheduler switch. Miguel's IO library is for this. Read more about this. I have it in other notes but a google search will suffice. Both eventlet and gevent allow monkeypatching to coroutine friendly functions (overwrite standard library function with the coroutine friendly function). Using Production Web Servers (tag: v0.12) gunicorn Limited load balancing - Why limited? I will have to look this up. Written in Python - robust but not lightning fast Supports multiple processes, and eventlet or gevent green threads. uwsgi nginx Written in C. Ideal for serving static files in production. You expose the static file in the nginx config. Bottlenecks: I/O Bound and CPU Bound I/O Bottlenecks Flack example: scraping links included in posts Solution: concurrent request handlers through multiple threads, processes, or green threads. Make I/O heavy requests asynchronous. CPU Bottlenecks Flack example: rendering posts from markdown to HTML Solution: Offload CPU intensive requests to auxiliary threads or processes to keep the server unblocked. Rephrased: make CPU intensive requests asynchronous. Asynchronous HTTP Requests (tag: v0.13) Request starts background work, gives a status 202. Goes back to listening requests. Location header has a status URL where the client can ask for status for the asynchronous task. Request to status URL returns 202 while the request is still in progress. When complete, (see presentation for details) There is a decorator for this in flack , migue's app.... @async decorator. That's all that is necessary!!! This is almost too easy. If you git diff v0.12 v0.13 and view the tasks module, you can see async implemenation. note that request.environ has environmental information to build a request object. This way miguel can build his own request object. Miguel uses threading here, I think this won't matter because the threads are being used inside of a single request. We went into great detail about the @async decorator code. Miguel mentioned maybe he should test it more and build a flask extension out of it. Probably production ready but definitely not widely tested. Async really gets into the guts of flask and does a lot of stuff flask does manually building the response etc. it looks good but it just isn't vetted and I don't know enough flask futs to vet it. Celery Workers (tag: v0.14) There's a wrapper in manage.py . Celery is integrated into the previous async section. For quick setup redis works with Celery. Celery needs to be available in init .py for the same reason as the model. Flask uses the context apparently. There must be something else since flask doesn't really 'expect' celery. Maybe celery is loaded up in the app then refers to stuff.. Still seems a little circular. Websocket (tag: v0.15) - clients must 'poll' to stay up to date... we need to use 'server-push' to reduce load when new stuff happens. This \"server-push\" websocket model will reduce load, removing all redundant quests. The previous version used 2 requests per second per client just to stay up to date. Options: 1. Streaming 2. Long-polling 3. WebSocket 4. Socket.IO (long-polling + WebSocket) Streaming One of Miguel Grinberg's Posts using Streaming (1): http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask Long polling client asks 'is there anything new?' but the server doesn't respond right away. it waits maybe 10 seconds because nothing happened. it does block the thread but it doesn't respond until something changes or until the long poll times out. A new one can then be generated. WebSocket HTML5 Standard. Not HTTP anymore. Both connections can write to the other side at any time. Any side can write/read at any time. SocketIO written in JS. Node.js service. SocketIO Protocol supports WebSocket and falls aback to long-polling if WebSocket isn't supported by the client. Type 1: Python client: use socketio.emit class in a push_model method. See slides. Javascript server: socketio node.js service Type 2: Python Server: @socketio.on() decorator Javascript client: socket.emit(). See slides. Even more Socket.IO. We can now only use gevent or eventlet. See the events.py module git diff v0.14 v0.15 , added to manage events. I'm pretty far afield of things I have actually done at this point so my thoughts aren't very helpful. This code is starting to look a ton like django. However, I don't think Django has async built in either, so maybe this is a limit for out-of-the-box django as well. More research needed. Need an auxiliary wsgi process for socketio. There is a second wsgi_aux.py or something in the source. Miguel used eventlet.monkey_patch() to replace a bunch of stuff with eventlet counterparts. This seems pretty specific, better know what you are doing and read the monkey patch code. manage.py runserver needs socketio stuff. Socketio needs socketio.run, rather than app.run, so this gets added in. Also see tests. socketio has its own test client. Finally nginx has requirements for load balancing. Nginx option \"sticky sessions\" Grep the flack.conf in the nginx folder for ip_hash and read about this nginx option. Socketio is stateful and rest APIs are stateless so this option is necessary.

Move utility functions to utils.py (tag: v0.2) url_for, timestamp functions. 2. Refactor database models. (tag: v0.3) Avoid cyclic dependency of importing db from controller then importing model from models.py Add a check for main in models.py, if there isn't a main then fallback to ugly hardcoded \"from flack import db\". 3. Create an Application Package (tag: v0.4) - Use Flask-Script A newer option exists over Flask-Script but is not yet production ready. Flask-Script is available now: https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ See git diff v0.3 v0.4 between these two tags to understand necessary changes. 4. Refactoring API Authentication (tag: v0.5) - Moved auth stuff to auth.py. There were three auth functions finally imported. Again see git diff v0.4 v0.5 for details. 5. Refactoring Tests (tag: v0.6) - Change to a package style folder structure. To get the overview, checkout this tag and manage.py. Look at file structure. Now we are in a django style construction. tests folder exists alongside flack folder. 6. Refactoring Configuration (tag: v0.7) - Add a config.py next to manage.py. Add a config.py. This is pretty hairy even in django. People solve configuration in different ways. I have a pretty good django dev.cfg/prod.cfg pattern that I would use here. 7. Create an API Blueprint - separate the api. Create: flack/api.py . Use a Blueprint. Blueprint is initialized where app creation is done, currently flack.py. 8. Create Stats package. See git diff v0.8 v0.9 9. Using an application Factory Function (tag: v0.10) - use a Blueprint for app. Sometimes it is desirable to work with more than one application Best Example: Unit tests that need applications with different configurations. SPECIAL NOTE: Having app blueprints allows you to have a really elegant test setup and teardown. Howto get the Blueprint working (see git diff v0.9 v.10 for exact code) We need to get rid of app because it will exist outside the context of the controller. Now we can no longer reference app. We must refactor app.config and other references to app. That means no app.debug. To achieve this we can use a Blueprint. Use the current_app context variable to access application. Put application factory function in init .py, see create_app function here. To create an app you now call create_app, pass an application name, and get the app. SQLAlchemy needs the models in init .py because it introspects on the app. You can miss this and maybe the models get imported elsewhere but that is sloppy. 10. Creating an API Package (tag: v0.11) - Turn api.py into a package. This is a simple step, make an api folder and break the components of api.py down into the 3 files/modules: tokens, messages, users. tokens, messages, users become modules inside of the api package.

That's all that is necessary!!! This is almost too easy. If you git diff v0.12 v0.13 and view the tasks module, you can see async implemenation. note that request.environ has environmental information to build a request object. This way miguel can build his own request object. Miguel uses threading here, I think this won't matter because the threads are being used inside of a single request. We went into great detail about the @async decorator code. Miguel mentioned maybe he should test it more and build a flask extension out of it.
